<h3>BUSINESS AND LOVE.</h3>


<p>Roland had but a few days to spend at Redborough,
where he came on the footing of an intimate
friend and relation, sought and courted on all
hands. His time was already portioned out among
the Vernons before he came to pay his respects to
Mrs. John and her daughter, though that was on
the morning after his arrival. At a still earlier hour
Emma had rushed in very tearful and dejected to
beg Hester to intercede for her that she might not
go away.</p>

<p>"If I go now <i>he</i> may never speak at all," Emma
said. "I am sure I did everything I could last night
to bring it on. I told him Roland had come for me,
that he couldn't do without me any longer; and if
you could only have seen him, Hester! he grew
quite white, poor fellow, and his eyes as big as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
saucers! I don't believe it is his fault. It must
be his people; so often, when things are going just
as you wish, their people will interfere. I am sure
he is quite miserable. And if he doesn't speak now,
I dare say he will never speak."</p>

<p>"How can you talk as if it were a matter of business?"
cried Hester; "if he cares for you he is sure
to 'speak,' as you call it. And as for bringing it
on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, of course, it is a matter of business," said
Emma, "and very important business too. What
can be so important for a girl as settling? It is all
very well for you to talk, but I am the youngest, and
I have no fixed home, and I must think of myself.
If he comes forward it makes all the difference to
me. Why, Roland and everybody will think twice
as much of me if I have an offer. Hester, there's a
dear, do persuade Roland to let me stay. He doesn't
want me a bit, that's all talk; he is just as happy
without me. Perhaps he will tell you they have had
enough of me here; but they don't say so, and you're
not bound to go and inquire into people's feelings if
they don't say so. I do believe grandpapa is tired of
having me, but he will never turn me out; and when
it is so essential to my best interests! Hester, I
think you might have a little fellow-feeling. There's
Edward Vernon, I'm sure you would be more comfortable
if he were to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hester turned upon her indiscreet companion with
a blaze of indignation. The fact that there was
truth in it made it doubly odious. Her whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
frame trembled with angry shame. She threw up
her hand with an impatient gesture, which frightened
and silenced Emma, but which Hester herself
afterwards felt to be a sort of appeal to her forbearance&mdash;the
establishment of a kind of confidence.</p>

<p>"What is that about Edward Vernon?" said Mrs.
John, whose tranquil ear had caught something,
naturally of that part of the conversation which it
was most expedient she should not hear.</p>

<p>Emma paused, and consulted Hester with her eyes,
who, however, averted her countenance and would
not ask forbearance. A rapid debate ensued in
Emma's mind. What is the use, she asked herself,
of having a mother if you cannot tell her everything,
and get her to help you? But on the other
hand, if Hester did not wish it spoken of she did not
dare to oppose an auxiliary who might be of so much
service to her. So she answered carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing! but don't you think, Mrs. Vernon,
you who know the world, that for a girl to go away
just when a gentleman is coming to the point, is a
great pity? And just as likely as not nothing may
ever come of it if her people interfere like this and
drag her away."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. John, astonished, though
mollified by the compliment to her knowledge of the
world, "I cannot call to mind that I have ever heard
such a question discussed before."</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps not&mdash;not in general society; but
when we are all women together, and a kind of relations,
I am sure it is only charity to wish that a girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
like me might get settled. And when you have had
an offer you take such a different position, even with
your own people. I want Hester to ask Roland to
let me stay."</p>

<p>"Hester! but why Hester? If you wish it I will
speak to Mr. Ashton&mdash;or your grandparents would be
more suitable," Mrs. John said.</p>

<p>And it was at this moment that Roland himself
came in to pay his respects. When he had said
everything that was polite&mdash;nay, more than polite,
ingratiating and devoted, as if in a subdued and
reverential way he was paying his court to the
mother rather than the daughter&mdash;he contrived to
make his way to where Hester sat apart, working
with great but spasmodic energy, and not yet recovered
from the ferment into which Emma had
plunged her. "I scarcely saw you last night," he
said.</p>

<p>"There were so many people to see," Hester
replied, with a cloudy smile, without lifting her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, there were a great many people. And
to-morrow night, I hear, at the Merridews&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not going."</p>

<p>"No? I thought I should have been able to see
a little of you there. A ball-room is good for that,
that one&mdash;I mean, two&mdash;may be alone in it now and
then&mdash;and there were many things I wanted to say.
But I thought you did go."</p>

<p>"Yes, often; but I am tired of it!" cried Hester.
"It is too much; one wants something more than
folly in one's life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is not folly," he said, looking round at the
quiet little room, the tranquil lady by the fire, the
work at which Hester's hands were so busy. She
was seated near the side window which looked out
upon the road.</p>

<p>"No; this is dulness&mdash;this is nothing," she said;
"not living at all, but only going on because one
cannot help it."</p>

<p>"I suppose, on the whole, the greater part of life
is that; but you, with the power to make others
happy, with so much before you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sure the life that I know is all that,"
cried Hester; "we are here, we don't know why,
we cannot get out of it, we must go on with it.
It is a necessity to live, and prepare your dinner
every day and mend your clothes, not because you
wish to do so, but because you can't help yourself.
And then the only relief to it is folly."</p>

<p>"Don't call an innocent little dance folly, with all
its opportunities. If it gave me the chance of a long
quiet talk&mdash;with you."</p>

<p>"If that is not folly, it is nonsense," Hester said,
with a laugh, not unmoved by the tone, not unsubdued
by the eyes.</p>

<p>"You may think so, but I don't. I have looked
forward to it for so long. If life is nothing to you
here, fancy what it is to me in the Stock
Exchange."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt it is very interesting to you. It
is something to do: it is change, and thought, and
risk, and all that one wants."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is what Edward Vernon says," said Roland.
"He, too, finds life monotonous&mdash;I suppose because
he has everything he wishes for."</p>

<p>"Has he everything he wishes for?" said Hester,
with a catch of her breath, and a sudden glance up
with keen, questioning eyes. The next moment she
bent her head again over her work. "What I want
is not dancing," she said.</p>

<p>"It is work, according to the fashion of young
ladies. You don't know when you are well off. You
have always wanted work," said Roland, "and barbarous
parents will not let you. You want to go and
teach wretched little children, and earn a little
miserable money. You to be wasted on that! Ah! you
have something a great deal better to do."</p>

<p>"What?" said Hester, raising her eyes and fixing
them upon him. "I should like, not that, but to
do as Catherine Vernon did," she cried, lighting up
in every line of her animated countenance. "I
should like to step in when ruin was coming and
prop it up on my shoulders as she did, and meet the
danger, and overcome it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you hated Catherine Vernon," Roland
cried.</p>

<p>"I never said so," cried Hester; and then, after
a pause, "but if I did, what does that matter? I
should like to do what she did. Something of one's
own free will&mdash;something that no one can tell you
or require you to do&mdash;which is not even your duty
bound down upon you. Something voluntary, even
dangerous&mdash;&mdash;" She paused again, with a smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and a blush at her own vehemence, and shook her
head. "That is exactly what I shall never have it
in my power to do."</p>

<p>"I hope not, indeed, if it is dangerous," said
Roland, with all that eyes could say to make the
words eloquent. "Pardon me; but don't you think
that is far less than what you have in your power?
You can make others do: you can inspire (isn't that
what Lord Lytton says?) and reward. That is a
little highflown, perhaps. But there is nothing a
man might not do, with you to encourage him. You
make me wish to be a hero."</p>

<p>He laughed, but Hester did not laugh. She gave
him a keen look, in which there was a touch of
disdain. "Do you really think," she said, "that the
charm of inspiring, as you call it, is what any
reasonable creature would prefer to doing? To make
somebody else a hero rather than be a hero yourself?
Women would need to be disinterested indeed if they
like that best. I don't see it. Besides, we are not
in the days of chivalry. What could you be inspired
to do&mdash;make better bargains on your Stock Exchange?
and reward&mdash;&mdash; Oh, that is not the way
it is looked at nowadays. You think it is you
who&mdash;&mdash;" Here Hester paused, with a rising
colour, "I will not say what I was going to say,"
she said.</p>

<p>"What you were going to say was cruel. Besides,
it was not true. I must know best, being on the
side of the slandered. A man who is worth calling
a man can have but one opinion on that subject."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Hester looked at him again with a serious criticism,
which embarrassed Roland. She was not
regarding the question lightly, as a mere subject of
provocative talk, but was surveying him as if to
read how far he was true and how far fictitious.
Before he could say anything she shook her head
with a little sigh.</p>

<p>"Besides," she said, "it was not a hero I was
thinking of. If anybody, it was Catherine Vernon."</p>

<p>"Whom you don't like. These women, who step
out of their sphere, they may do much to be
respected, they may be of great use; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean that men don't like them," said
Hester, with a smile; "but then women do; and,
after all, we are the half of creation&mdash;or more."</p>

<p>"Women do! Oh, no; that is a mistake. Let us
ask the company present&mdash;your mother and my sister."</p>

<p>Hester put out her hand to stop him. "That
goes far deeper," she said, with a rising blush.
What did she mean? Roland was sufficiently versed
in all the questions of this kind, which are discussed
in idleness to promote flirtation. But he did not
know why she should blush so deeply, or why her
forehead should contract when he claimed his sister
and her mother together as representatives of
women. They were so, better than Hester herself
was. Mrs. John represented all the timid opinions
and obstinate prejudices of weakness; all that is
gently conventional and stereotyped in that creature
conventionally talked about as Woman from the
beginning of time; while the other represented that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
other, vulgarer type of feminine character which,
without being either strong enough or generous
enough to strike out a new belief, makes a practical
and cynical commentary upon the old one, and
considers man as the natural provider of woman's
comfort, and, therefore, indispensable, to be secured
as any other source of income and ease ought to be
secured. Hester was wounded and ashamed that
her mother should be classed with Emma, but could
say nothing against it; and she was moved with a
high indignation to think that Roland was right.
But he had not the least idea what she could mean,
and she had no mind to enlighten him. Their
conversation came to an end accordingly; and the
sound of the others came in.</p>

<p>"I don't see why I should go away," said Emma.
"For, whatever he may choose to say, Roland
doesn't want me, not a bit. Elizabeth is a very
good cook, and that's all a man thinks of. I couldn't
do him any good at home, and he doesn't like my
acquaintances. A girl can't live without friends,
can she, Mrs. John? If you are to have any amusement
at all, you must be getting it when you're
about twenty, that is the time. But men never
care: they go out, and they have their own friends
separate, and they never think of you. But here,
without bothering him a bit, I have lots of nice
people, and grandmamma has never said she was
tired of me. Then why should he take me
away?"</p>

<p>"There is no reason for talking of that just now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
at all," said Mrs. John politely, "for Mr. Roland
is not going away himself as yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, he cannot stay long," cried Emma, "he
oughtn't to stay; he has got his business&mdash;not like
me that have nothing to call me. Edward Vernon
wouldn't like it a bit if Roland stayed away from
his business."</p>

<p>"I am always hearing the name of Edward
Vernon," said Mrs. John; "you mentioned it to
Hester just now. What has he to do with Hester
or with Mr. Roland's business? Though Catherine
Vernon thinks so much of him, he is not one of my
favourites. I like his cousin Harry better."</p>

<p>"And so do I," Roland said.</p>

<p>They all looked at him with surprise, and Hester
with a sudden increase of colour. She was angry,
though she could not have told why.</p>

<p>"He is very hot and eager in business," Roland
said. "I suppose I ought to like him the better for
that. And he has a keen eye too; but it goes to
his head, and that is what one never should allow
one's business to do."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Mrs. John, "if it can be prevented,
Mr. Roland. That was what happened to my dear
husband. He could not be cool, as, I suppose, it is
right to be. But sometimes, don't you think one
likes a person better for not calculating too much,
for letting himself be carried away?"</p>

<p>Roland looked more dark than he had ever been
seen to look before, and responded vaguely, "Perhaps,"
with a face that had no doubtfulness in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should he not be hot and eager?" cried
Hester; "I understand that very well. Everything
is quiet here. A man, when he gets out of this still
atmosphere, wants a little excitement, and to fling
himself into it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. John, "that is what your poor
father always said."</p>

<p>But Roland had never looked so unsympathetic.
"A man may lose his head in love or in war, or in
adventure, or in pleasure, but he must not lose it on
the Stock Exchange," he said; then, looking up, with
an uneasy laugh, "I need not warn you, ladies, need
I? for you will never lose your heads about shares and
premiums. I am glad to think I am a very steady
fellow myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, steady!" cried Mrs. John, alarmed. "I
hope, I am sure, they are all <i>quite</i> steady. I
never heard a word to the contrary. It would be
dreadful for poor Catherine; after all, though we are
not very good friends&mdash;not such good friends as I
should wish to be&mdash;it would be dreadful; for if
Edward was not steady&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I hope, Mr.
Roland, you are mistaken. I hope that it is
not so."</p>

<p>"He means a steady head, mother; there is no
question of anything else," said Hester, very red
and troubled. Her secret consciousness in respect
to Edward made life and conversation very difficult
for her: she could not bear any animadversion upon
him, though in her own heart she made many; and
at the same time she could not defend him openly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
What was he to her more than Harry was? The
same far-off cousin&mdash;old friend: not so much, indeed,
as Harry, for all the world knew that Harry
would fain have established another relationship
had it seemed good in Hester's eyes.</p>

<p>"I meant nothing against his morals," Roland
said.</p>

<p>"That is a great relief to my mind," said Mrs.
John, "for Catherine Vernon is a good woman,
though she and I have never been great friends;
and it is a terrible thing to set your heart upon a
child and have him turn out badly. There is
nothing so heartrending as that. One of my
mother's sisters, Aunt Eliza, of whom you have
heard me talk, Hester, had a son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I don't think we want to hear
about that."</p>

<p>"And you were coming out for a walk," said
Emma, who saw that her own affairs were slipping
out of notice. "Didn't she say she would come out
for a walk? And if we are going we had better
not be long about it, for the days are so short at
this time of the year."</p>

<p>"Put on your hat, Hester; it will do you good.
You change colour so I do not know what to make
of it," her mother said.</p>

<p>"And so do I now," cried Emma; "they always
tell me it is indigestion, but that is not a nice
reason to give when people think you are blushing
about something. It is very disagreeable. Mine
comes on often after dinner when we dine early, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
all the afternoon I am just a fright! It is a blessing
it goes off towards evening when one is seeing
people. Roland, you must take Hester and me into
Redborough. I want to buy some gloves, and I dare
say so does she, for the Merridews to-night."</p>

<p>"She is not going to the Merridews," said Mrs.
John, with a plaintive sound in her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, she told us something about that, but I
didn't believe it was true. Why shouldn't she go
to the Merridews?&mdash;she that is always made so
much of, just like the sister of the house. If I
had that position I never should miss one evening;
and, indeed, I never have since I had my first
invitation. Grandpapa did not like it at first, but
of course he got reconciled. Oh, here you are,
Hester; how quickly you do dress! To be sure,
you never put on anything but that pea-coat of
yours. But I don't like drawing on my gloves as
I go out, as you do; I like to put them on carefully,
and smooth them, and button them up."</p>

<p>"You are always so tidy," said Mrs. John, with a
faint sigh. She could not but feel it would be an
advantage if Hester, though so much superior,
would get some of Emma's ways. She was so
neat: never a hair out of order, or a shoe-tie
loose. Whereas, now and then, in her own child,
there were imperfections. But she smiled as she
looked after them, going out to the door to see them
go. Hester, with her varying complexion (which
had nothing to do with her digestion), threw up her
head to meet the wind with a movement so vigorous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
so full of grace and life, that it was a pleasure to
see. The mother thought that it was pretty to
watch her drawing on her gloves, though, perhaps,
it would have been tidier to button them carefully
as Emma did, before she came down stairs; but
then in those days gloves had few buttons and
were easily managed. As soon as they had gone
out of the gate of the Vernonry, Emma gave Hester
a significant look, and even a nudge, if it must be
told, and begged them to walk on while she ran in
for an umbrella which she had forgotten. "For it
always rains when one hasn't an umbrella," she
said. It cost Hester an effort to remember what
the look and the nudge meant. Then she laughed
as she watched the schemer down to Captain
Morgan's door.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to take Emma away?" she
said. "She seems to be happy here."</p>

<p>"Do you think she makes the old people happier?
They don't say anything, but she seems to me to worry
my old grandfather. I don't want to take her away.
She has her little schemes on hand, no doubt, and
means to settle or something; but I cannot let her
tire out the old people. They are part of my religion,"
Roland said. This, too, was meant as provocation to
draw Hester on to discuss the question of religion,
perhaps to an attempt to convert him to sounder
views, which is a very fruitful method. He looked
at her with a pleased defiance in his eyes. But
Hester was not to be drawn out on this subject. She
had no dogmatic teaching in her, and did not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
qualified to discuss a man's religion. Instead, she
returned to the subject of their previous discussion,
herself abandoning Emma's cause.</p>

<p>"What do you do on the Stock Exchange?" she
said.</p>

<p>"That is a tremendous question. I don't know
how to answer it. I should have to give you a
lecture upon shares, and companies, and all the
vicissitudes of the Funds."</p>

<p>"These, I suppose, are your material, just as
written things are the material of a newspaper editor.
I understand that," said Hester, "what I want to
know is what you do."</p>

<p>"We buy and we sell," he said, with a laugh. "We
are no better than any shopkeeper. We buy a thing
when it is cheap, and hold it till it becomes dear,
and then we sell it again."</p>

<p>"But who," said Hester, with a little scorn, "is so
silly as to buy things <i>when they are dear</i>? Is it to
oblige you? I thought that was against political
economy&mdash;and everything of that kind," she added
vaguely. It was not the subject Roland would have
chosen, but out of that, too, he could draw the
thread of talk.</p>

<p>"Political economy is not infallible," he said. "We
praise our wares so, and represent their excellence so
warmly, that there comes a moment when everybody
wishes to buy them. Sometimes they deserve the
commendations we bestow, sometimes they&mdash;don't.
But in either case people buy. And then political
economy comes in, and the demand being great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
increases the value; so that sometimes we make a
nice little bit of profit without spending a penny."</p>

<p>Hester looked at him with a blank face. She
knew nothing about these mysteries. She shook
her head.</p>

<p>"I don't understand business," she said; "but how
can you buy without spending a penny? I wish
I knew how to do that."</p>

<p>"I should like to do it for you," said Roland, with
a look that said still more; for even stockbroking
will do as a vehicle for flirtation. "I should like to
buy you a quantity of Circassians, for instance, exactly
at the right moment, neither too soon nor too late,
and sell them next day, perhaps, when the market
had turned, and hand you over a thousand pounds or
two which you should have made without, as I said,
spending a penny. That would make the profession
romantic, poetic, if one could conduct such operations
for <i>you</i>. Probably I shall put that money into the
pocket of some bilious city person who does not want
it, instead of into your fair hands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which do. I don't know if they are fair hands,
but they want it certainly. A thousand or two!
enough to make people comfortable for life. And
what are Circassians?" Hester asked.</p>

<p>"They are stock. You must accept certain words
as symbols, or we shall never make it clear. And my
business is to watch the market for you, to catch the
moment when the tide is turning. There is a great
deal of excitement in it."</p>

<p>"And is that how Edward loses his head?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>She spoke in a low tone, and Roland stopped
suddenly in what he was about to say, and turned
upon her with real surprise. After this he put on an
air of mock mortification&mdash;mock, yet not without
a mixture of the true.</p>

<p>"Is it for this," he said, "that I have been devising
delicate operations for you, and explaining all
my mysteries? to find you at the end not in the least
interested in my work or in your possible fortune,
but considering everything in the light of Edward
Vernon? Acknowledge that this is hard upon me."</p>

<p>"I was thinking only," said Hester, with again
that sudden flush of colour, "of what you said, that
Edward lost his head. It is not much wonder if
what you say can be. He would like to be rich; he
would like to be free. He would prefer to get a
fortune of his own, especially if it can be done that
way, rather than to wait for years and years, till he
has made money, or till Catherine dies. That is
generous, you know. He does not want to wait till
she dies, as if he grudged her life. It would be
terrible for her to think that he did not wish her to
live as long as she could. But at the same time he
wants, and so do we all, to be free."</p>

<p>"I am so much obliged to you for explaining
Edward Vernon's motives," said Roland, much
piqued. It was an experience he was not familiar
with, to have himself forgotten and his rival expounded
to him. His rival! was he his rival? In
the sting of this sudden revelation of preference,
Roland all but vowed that he would enter the lists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in earnest and chase this Edward, this country-fellow
whom she thought so much of, from the field.</p>

<p>Hester was confused, too, when her investigation
into her cousin's mind was thus received. It was
true enough; it was the problem which had interested
her in the first place&mdash;not directly Edward in
person who was the subject of it. She had tried to
explain his position to herself. Now that her
interest was found out, and she discovered it to
be an offence to her companion, she threw herself
back instinctively on a less alarming question.</p>

<p>"I think a great deal about Catherine," she
said.</p>

<p>"About Catherine&mdash;Cousin Catherine&mdash;whom I
thought you disliked with all your heart?"</p>

<p>"You may be astonished, but it is true. I think
a great deal about her. I think of her, after being
kind to everybody&mdash;for now that I am grown up I
begin to understand, she has been very kind to
everybody; not loving them, which takes the grace
out of it&mdash;but yet kind, after being so kind, to be left
alone with nobody caring for her, and perhaps the
one she loves best expecting when she will die.
No," said Hester, "I am glad Edward loses his head&mdash;that
is what he is thinking of. Not to wait or
feel as if he would like by an hour to shorten her
life, but only for himself, like a man, to get free. I
am very glad of it," she added hotly, with another
overwhelming blush, "for Catherine's sake."</p>

<p>Roland was bewildered and doubtful what to think,
for truth was so strong in Hester that it was hard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
believe she was sheltering herself behind a fiction.
But he was very much mortified too.</p>

<p>"I don't think," he said, plaintively, "that I want
to talk either of Cousin Catherine or of Mr. Edward,
whom she thinks a great deal more of than he
deserves&mdash;as, perhaps others do, too."</p>

<p>"And we have come on so fast and forgotten
Emma!" cried Hester, with a sense of guilt. "We
ought to go back and meet her. She has been a
long time getting that umbrella. Don't you think
you had better leave her with Mrs. Morgan a little
longer since she likes to be here?"</p>

<p>"I shall not disturb her if&mdash;you wish her to stay,"
he meant to say if she wishes to stay, but changed
his phrase and gave it emphasis, with a look of
devotion. "If I thought you had any regard for
my poor little sister how glad it would make me.
It would do her so much good; it would alter her
way of looking at things."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must not think," cried Hester, meaning,
like him, to say one thing and saying another, "that
Emma is likely to be influenced by me. She knows
what she thinks much better than I do&mdash;&mdash; Mr.
Ashton, would it not turn one's head and make one
unfit for one's other business if one was trying to
make money in <i>that</i> way?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Roland said.</p>

<p>"Has it not that effect upon you?"</p>

<p>"But it is my business. I don't act for myself.
I am tempted sometimes to do things I ought not to
do, and sometimes I fall. Even you, if you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
tempted, would sometimes fall. You would dabble
in Circassians, you would find a new company too
much for your virtue; shares going to-day for next
to nothing but sure to be at a premium next week&mdash;if
the bubble doesn't burst in the meantime."</p>

<p>"And does it always happen that the bubbles
burst?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not always; but after you have done with
them you don't care what becomes of them. I
never thought I should have had you for half an
hour all to myself, and talked of business the whole
time. It is incredible; and there is that little
Emma running this way as if she thought we were
inconsolable for the loss of her. I wanted to tell
you how much I have been thinking of all our talks
since I have been in my little house alone. Did you
never think of coming to London? The very feeling
of being in a place so full of life and action,
and thinking, makes your veins thrill. I think you
would like to be there. There is so much going on.
And then I might have the hope of seeing you
sometimes. That is one for you and two for
myself."</p>

<p>"We could not afford it," said Hester, colouring
again. "I think I should like it. I am not sure.
To look on and see everybody doing a great deal
would be intolerable if one had nothing to do."</p>

<p>"What are you talking of?" cried Emma coming
up breathless. "I couldn't find that umbrella. I
went up and down into every room in the house,
and then I found I had left it in your drawing-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Hester, and your mamma looked up when I
went in, and said, 'Back already!' I think she
must have been dozing, for we could not possibly
have gone to Redborough and back in this time,
could we, Roland? You two looked so comfortable
by yourselves I had half a mind not to come at all:
for you know two's company but three's none. And
then I thought you didn't know my number, and
Roland would never have had the thought to bring
me my gloves. But don't be afraid, I dare say I
shall pick up some one on the way."</p>

<p>They walked into the town after this, and bought
Emma's gloves. Hester could not be tempted into
a similar purchase, nor could she be persuaded to
go to the Merridews. And she resisted all Roland's
attempts to make himself agreeable, even after
Emma encountered young Reginald Merridew, who
was glad enough to help her to buy her gloves.
Though it was not many months since she had seen
him, Hester felt that she had outgrown Roland.
His eyes were very fine, but they did not affect
her any more. He brought no light with him into
the problems of life, but only another difficulty,
which it was more and more hard to solve. A
sort of instinctive consciousness that something was
going to happen seemed in the air about her. All
was still, and everything going on in its calm
habitual way. There were not even any heavings
and groanings, like those that warn the surrounding
country before a volcano bursts forth. Nevertheless,
this girl, who had been so long a spectator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
pushed aside from the action about her, but with
the keen sight of injured pride and wounded feeling,
seeing the secret thread of meaning that ran
through everything, felt premonitions, she could not
tell how, in the heated air, and through the
domestic calm.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>A SPECULATOR.</h3>


<p>Roland's Christmas visit to his friends was not
the holiday it appeared. His engagements with
them had been many during this interval, and
attended both by loss and gain; but the gain had
outbalanced the loss, and though there had been
many vicissitudes and a great many small crises, the
Christmas balance had shown tolerably well, and
every one was pleased. Edward's private ventures,
which he had not consulted any one about, but in
which the money of the bank had been more or less
involved, had followed the same course. He had a
larger sum standing to his individual credit than
ever before, and, so far as any one knew, had risked
nothing but what he had a right to risk, though, in
reality, his transactions had gone much further than
any one was aware of, even Ashton; for he had felt
the restraints of Roland's caution, and had already
established, though to a limited extent, dealings with
other agents of bolder disposition. And, indeed, his
mind had gone further than his practice, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
reached a point of excitement at which the boundaries
of right and wrong become so indistinct as to
exert little, if any, control over either the conscience
or the imagination. Through his other channels of
information he had heard of a speculation greater
than he had yet ventured upon, in which the possible
gain would be immense, but the risk proportionate&mdash;almost
proportionate&mdash;though the probabilities were
so entirely in favour of success that a sanguine eye
could fix itself upon them with more justification
than is usual. It was so vast that even to Edward,
who had been playing with fire for months back,
the suggestion took away his breath, and he took
what was in reality the wise step of consulting
Ashton. It was wise had he intended seriously to
be guided by Ashton, but it was foolish as it happened,
seeing that a day or two's contemplation of
the matter wrought in him a determination to risk
it, whether Ashton approved or not. And Roland
did not approve. He came down at the utmost speed
of the express to stop any further mischief if he
could. He had himself always kept carefully within
the bounds of legitimate business; sometimes,
indeed, just skirting the edge, but never committing
himself or risking his credit deeply, and he had
never forgot the solemn adjuration addressed to him
by both the old people at the Vernonry. If
Catherine Vernon or her representatives came to
harm it should not be, he had determined, by his
means. So he had answered Edward's appeal in
person; and, instead of communicating with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
only, had spoken of the matter to Harry, supposing
him to be in all Edward's secrets, a thing which
disturbed Edward's composure greatly. It was his
own fault he felt for so distrusting his own judgment;
but he durst not betray his displeasure: and
so the proposal which he had meant to keep to
himself had to be discussed openly between the
partners. Harry, as may be supposed, being passive
and unambitious, opposed it with all his might.
Roland had been shut up with them in Edward's
room at the bank for hours in the morning, and the
discussion had run high. He had been a kind of
moderator between them, finding Harry's resistance
to some extent unnecessary, but, on the whole, feeling
more sympathy with him than with the other. "It
isn't ourselves only we have to consider," Harry said;
and he repeated this, perhaps too often, often enough
to give his opponent a sort of right to say that this
was a truism, and that they had heard it before.</p>

<p>"A thing does not become more true for being
repeated," Edward said.</p>

<p>"But it does not become less true," said Roland;
"and I think so far that Harry is right. With all
your responsibilities you ought to go more softly than
men who risk nothing that is not their own. You
are in something of the same position as trustees, and
you know how they are tied up."</p>

<p>"This is a statement which hardly comes well from
you," said Edward, "who have been our adviser all
along, and sailed very near the wind on some
occasions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have never advised you to anything I did not
think safe," said Roland.</p>

<p>Edward was so eager and so confident of his
superiority over his cousin, that it was difficult to
keep the suspicion of a sneer out of his voice in this
discussion, though for Roland Ashton, whatever his
other sentiments might be, he at least had no feeling
of contempt.</p>

<p>"And there's Aunt Catherine," said Harry. "Of
course a great part of the money's hers. Her hair
would stand on end if she knew we were even
discussing such a question."</p>

<p>"Aunt Catherine is&mdash;all very well; but she's an
old woman. She may have understood business in
her day. I suppose she did, or things would not
have come to us in the state they are. But we
cannot permit ourselves to be kept in the old jogtrot
because of Aunt Catherine. She departed from her
father's rule, no doubt. One generation can't mould
itself upon another. At least that is not what I
understand by business."</p>

<p>"And there was John Vernon, don't you know,"
said Harry. "He was a caution! I shouldn't like
to follow in his ways."</p>

<p>"John Vernon was a fool; he threw his chance
away. I've gone into it, and I know that nothing
could be more idiotic. And his extravagance was
unbounded. He burned the candle at both ends.
I hope you don't think I want to take John Vernon
for my model."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Harry, "that it's awfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
easy to be ruined by speculation. Something always
happens to put you out. There were those mines.
For my part I thought they were as safe as the
bank, and we lost a lot by them. There was nobody
to blame so far as I know. I don't mean to
stand in the way, or be obstructive, as you call
it, but we have got to consider other people besides
ourselves."</p>

<p>Roland did not look upon the matter exactly in
this way. He was not of Harry's stolid temperament.
He heard of a proposition so important with
something of the feelings of a war-horse when he
sniffs the battle. But his opposition was all the
more weighty that it was more or less against his
own will.</p>

<p>"In your place I do not think I should venture,"
he said. "If I were an independent capitalist,
entirely free&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would go in for it without a moment's
hesitation! Of course you would. And why should
we be hampered by imaginary restrictions? Aunt
Catherine&mdash;if it is her you are thinking of&mdash;need
know nothing about it, and we risk nobody so much
as we risk ourselves. Loss would be far more fatal
to us than to any one else. Am I likely to insist
upon anything which would make an end of myself
first of all if it went wrong?"</p>

<p>But the others were not convinced by this argument.
Harry shook his head, and repeated his formula.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't console anybody who was injured,
that you ruined yourself first of all," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor would it comfort me for the loss of a fortune
that other people had rejected it," cried Edward
with an angry smile.</p>

<p>His mind worked a great deal faster than the
conversation could go, and the discussion altogether
was highly distasteful to him. Harry had a right to
his say when the subject was broached, but it was
beyond measure embarrassing and disagreeable that
Harry should have heard anything about it. It was
all Ashton's fault, whom he had consulted by way of
satisfying his conscience merely, and whom he could
not silence or find fault with for betraying him, since,
of course, he wanted no one to suppose that he acted
upon his own impulse and meant to leave Harry out.
He could not express all this, but he could drop the
discussion, and Ashton (he thought to himself) along
with it. Let him prose as he would, and chime in
with Harry's little matter-of-fact ways, he (Edward)
had no intention to allow himself to be stopped.</p>

<p>"I would let it alone, if I were you," Roland said.
"It is a great temptation, and of course if you were
entirely independent&mdash;&mdash; But I would not risk a
penny of other people's money."</p>

<p>"That's just what I say. We have others to
consider besides ourselves," said the steadfast Harry.</p>

<p>Edward made no reply. He was outvoted for the
moment by voices which, he said to himself, had no
right to be heard on the question. The best thing
was to end the discussion and judge for himself.
And the contemplation of the step before him took
away his breath; it took the words out of his mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
There would be nothing to be said for it. In argument
it would be an indefensible proceeding. It
was a thing to do, not to think, much less talk
about. No one would have a word to say if (as
was all but absolutely certain) his operations were
attended by success. In that event his coolness, his
promptitude, his daring, would be the admiration of
everybody; and Harry himself, the obstructive, would
share the advantage, and nothing more would be
heard of his stock phrase. Edward felt that in reality
it was he who was considering others, who was working
for everybody's benefit; but to form such a
determination was enough to make the strongest
head swim, and it was necessary that he should
shake off all intrusion, and have time and solitude
to think it over in private.</p>

<p>The way in which he thus dropped the discussion
astonished both the other parties to it a little.
Edward was seldom convinceable if he took an idea
into his head, and he never acknowledged himself
beaten. But Harry at first was simple enough to
be able to believe that what he had himself said was
unanswerable, and that as nothing could be done
without his acquiescence, Ned showed his sense by
dropping the question. Roland was not so easily
reassured; but it was not his business, which makes
a wonderful difference in the way we consider a
subject, and it was not for him to continue a subject
which the persons chiefly concerned had dropped.
He strolled with Harry into his room presently on a
hint from Edward that he had something particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to do. Harry was not very busy. He did what
came under his special department with sufficient
diligence, but that was not oppressive work: the
clerks took it off his hands in great part. In all
important matters it was Mr. Edward who was first
consulted. Harry had rather a veto upon what was
proposed, than an active hand it; but he was very
steady, always present, setting the best example to
the clerks. Roland talked to him for a quarter of
an hour pleasantly enough about football, which
eased the minds which had been pondering speculation.
The result of the morning's conference was
shown in one way by his ready and unexpected
adherence to Mrs. John's statement that she liked
Harry best. Roland thought so too, but he did not
give any reason for it; and indeed, so far as intellectual
appreciation went, there was perhaps little
reason to give.</p>

<p>After Emma's gloves were bought, the group
sauntering through Redborough just at the hour
when all the fine people of the place were about,
were met in succession by the two cousins. Harry
had time only to pause for a minute or two, and talk
to the girls on his way to a meeting of the football
club, at which the matches of the season were to be
settled; but Edward, who was going their way,
walked with them as far as the Grange. He was
pale and preoccupied, with that fiery sparkle in his
eyes which told of some pressing subject for his
thoughts, and though those eyes shot forth a passing
gleam when he saw that Roland kept by Hester's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
side, and that he was left to Emma, the arrangement
perhaps on the whole was the most suitable one that
could have been made, for Emma wanted little help
in keeping up something which sounded sufficiently
like conversation. Her voice flowed on, with just a
pause now and then for the little assenting ejaculations
which were indispensable. Edward said "Yes,"
sometimes with a mark of interrogation, sometimes
without; and "Indeed," and "To be sure," and
"Exactly," as we all do in similar circumstances;
and the pair got on very well. Emma thought him
much nicer than usual, and Hester going on in front,
somewhat distracted from Roland's remarks by the
consciousness of the other behind her, was perhaps
more satisfied to hear his stray monosyllables than
if he had maintained a more active part in the
conversation. When they stopped in front of the
Grange, where Catherine Vernon, always at the
window, saw the group approaching, they were called
up stairs to her by a servant&mdash;an invitation, however,
which Hester did not accept. "My mother
will be waiting for me," she said; and while the
others obeyed the summons, she sped along the
wintry road by herself, not without that proud sense
of loneliness and shut-out-ness which the circumstances
made natural. Edward lingered a moment
to speak to her while the others went in, having
first ascertained that they were shaded by the
big holly at the gate and invisible from the
window.</p>

<p>"I must not go with you, though I want to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to you," he said. "When will this bondage be over?
But at the Merridews to-night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not going," she said, waving her hand as
she went on.</p>

<p>She was half pleased, yet altogether angry,
despising him (almost) for his precautions, yet
glad that he wanted to talk to her, and glad also
to disappoint him, if it is possible to describe so
complicated a state of mind. She went along with
a proud, swift step, her head held high, her girlish
figure instinct in every line with opposition and
self-will: or so at least Catherine Vernon thought,
who looked after her with such attention that she
was unaware of the entrance of the others, whom
she liked so much better than Hester. She laughed
as she suffered herself to be kissed by Emma, who
was always effusive in that way, and fed upon the
cheeks of her friends.</p>

<p>"So Princess Hester has not come with you,"
Catherine said. "I suppose I should have gone
down to the door to meet her, as one crowned
head receives another."</p>

<p>"Oh, she had to go home to her mother," said
Emma, who never spoke ill of anybody, and always
took the most matter-of-fact view of her neighbours'
proceedings.</p>

<p>Catherine laughed, and was amused (she thought)
by the girl's persistent holding aloof.</p>

<p>"All the same a cup of tea would not have
poisoned her," she said.</p>

<p>When the Ashtons left the Grange it was nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the hour of dinner, and Catherine did not remark
the silence of her companion. Edward had been
moody of late; he had not been of temper so
equable, or of attentions so unfailing, as in the
earlier years. But she was a tolerant woman,
anxious not to exact too much, and ready to represent
to herself that this was but "a phase," and
that the happier intercourse would return after a
time. She wondered sometimes was he in love?
that question which occurs so unnaturally to the mind
at moments when things are not going perfectly
well with young persons, either male or female.
Catherine thought that if his choice were but a
good one, she would be very glad that he should
marry. It would give to him that sense of settledness
which nothing else gives, and it would give to
her a share in all the new events and emotions of
family life. If only he made a good choice! the
whole secret of the situation of course was in that.
At dinner he was more cheerful, indeed full of
animation, doing everything that could be done
to amuse and please her, but excused himself from
following her to the drawing-room afterwards.</p>

<p>"You are going to Ellen's folly, I suppose," she
said, which was the name that the Merridew
entertainments held in the house.</p>

<p>"Very likely&mdash;but later," said he; "I have a
great deal to do."</p>

<p>Catherine smiled upon his diligence, but held
up a finger in admonition.</p>

<p>"I never approved of bringing work home," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
said. "I would rather for my own part you stayed
an hour longer at the bank. Home should be for
rest, and you should keep the two places distinct;
but I suppose you must learn that by experience,"
she said, putting her hand caressingly upon his
shoulder as he held the door open for her: and she
looked back upon him when she had passed out
with a little wave of her hand. "Don't sit too
long over your papers," she said.</p>

<p>He had <i>trop de z&egrave;le</i>. No fear of Edward shrinking
from his work. But experience would teach him
that it was better to give himself a little leisure
sometimes. Would experience teach him? she
asked herself, as she went up stairs. He was of
a fervid nature, apt perhaps to go too far in anything
that interested him. She reflected that she
had herself been older before she began to have
anything to do with business, and a woman looks
forward to home, to the seat by the fire, the novel,
the newspaper (if there is nothing better), the
domestic chat when that is to be had, with more
zest than a man does. What she herself liked would
have been to have him there opposite to her as he
used to be at first, talking, or reading as pleased him,
telling her his ideas. Why was it that this pleasant
state of affairs never continued? He preferred to
sit in the library now, to work, or perhaps only,
she began to fear, to be alone. The idea struck
Catherine sadly now she came to think of it. There
was a great difference. Why should men prefer to
sit alone, to abandon that domestic hearth which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
sounds so well in print, and which from Cowper
downward all the writers have celebrated. Even
Dickens (then the master of every heart) made it
appear delightful and attractive to everybody. And
yet the young man preferred to go and sit alone.
A wife would alter all that, provided only that the
choice he made was a good one, Catherine Vernon
said. The drawing-room was a model of comfort;
its furniture was not in the taste of the present day,
but the carpets were like moss into which the foot
sank, and the curtains were close drawn in warm,
ruddy, silken folds. The fire burnt brightly, reflected
from the brass and steel, which it cost so
much work to keep in perfect order. Catherine
sat in the warmest place just out of reach of the
glare, with a little table by her favourite easy-chair.
Impossible to find a room more entirely "the picture
of comfort" as people say. And few companions
could have been found more intelligent, more ready
to understand every allusion, and follow every suggestion,
than this old lady, who was not at all
conscious of being old. Yet her boy, her son, her
nephew, her chosen, whom she had taken to her
heart in place of all the other inmates who once
dwelt there, sat down stairs! How strange it was;
yet notwithstanding Catherine deposited herself in
her seat by the fire, with a sort of subdued happiness,
consequent on the fact that he was down stairs.
This gave a secondary satisfaction if nothing better
was to be had. It is all that many people have to
live upon. But if he had a wife that would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
all the difference. A wife he could not leave to sit
alone; provided only that his choice was a right
one! If Catherine had known that his choice,
so far as he had made a choice, had fallen upon
Hester, what would her sentiments have been? but
fortunately she did not know.</p>

<p>But if she could have looked into the library down
stairs, which had been given up to Edward as his
room, what would she have seen there? The sight
would have driven out of her mind all question about
a problematical wife: though indeed Edward always
prepared for domiciliary visitations, and believing
them to be the fruit of suspicion, not of love, was
ready in that case to have concealed his occupation
at the first sound of the door opening. He had an
open drawer close to him into which his materials
could have been thrown in a minute. He took these
precautions because, as has been said, Catherine
would sometimes carry him with her own hands a
cup of tea in affectionate kindness, and he thought it
was inquisitiveness to see what he was doing! She
had not done this now for a long time, but still he
was prepared against intrusion. The papers he was
examining he had brought himself in a black bag
from the safe in the bank. He had locked the black
bag into an old oak escritoire till after dinner. He
was looking over them now with the greatest care,
and a face full of suppressed, but almost solemn
excitement. They were securities of all kinds, and
meant an amount of money which went to Edward's
head even more than the chances of fortune. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
that in his power; no chance of being called upon to
produce them, or to render an account of the stewardship
which had been so freely committed to him! It
was enough to make any man's head go round. To
hesitate upon a speculation which might bring in
cent. per cent. when he had all these to fall back
upon, papers upon which he could easily find, to
meet a temporary need, any amount of money! and
of course no such need could be anything but temporary!
Edward was as little disposed to risk the
future of the bank as any one. He had wisdom
enough to know that it was his own sheet anchor, as
well as that of the family, and he had a pride in its
stability and high reputation, as they all had. That
Vernon's should be as safe as the Bank of England
was a family proverb which admitted of no doubt.
But why should Vernon's be affected except to its
advantage by really bold speculation? It was the
timid, half-hearted sort of operations that frittered
away both money and credit, which ruined people,
not anything which was really on a grand scale.
Edward represented to himself that ventures of this
great kind were rarely unsuccessful. There was a
security in their magnitude&mdash;small people could not
venture upon them; and what even if it did not succeed?
It blanched his countenance and caught his
breath to think of this, but (he said to himself) every
possibility, even the most unlikely, must be taken
into account. If it did not, here was what would
keep the credit of the bank scatheless until another
luckier stroke should make up for failure. For in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
such pursuits the last word was never said. Could
you but go on you were sure one time or another to
satisfy your fullest desires. This was the worst in
case of failure: but there was in reality no chance of
failure, every human probability was in favour of a
great, an almost overwhelming success.</p>

<p>There was almost a sense of triumph, though the
thrill of excitement had alarm in it also&mdash;in the
final calculations by which he made up his mind to
throw Ashton and prudence to the winds. He wrote
with a heart leaping high in his breast to the
other broker, whom he had already employed, before
he rose from his writing table. Ashton was a fool&mdash;he
would lose a large commission, and make nothing
by his preachment; and to think of that preachment
made Edward smile, though the smile was constrained
and dry&mdash;not a cheerful performance. Harry and
Ashton&mdash;they were a sensible couple to lecture him
as to what was best! It seemed to Edward that he
had himself far more insight and faculty than a dozen
such. Ashton indeed might know a thing or two.
He had proved himself a fool in this case, but
naturally he was not a fool. Advice might be received
from him, but dictation, never. And as for
Harry with his football, a ninny who had never been
trusted with any but the mechanical working of the
bank, it was too ridiculous that Harry should take
upon himself to advise. Edward got his letter ready
for the post with something of the feeling with which
a conspirator may be supposed to light the match by
which some deadly mine is to be fired. It may blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
himself into atoms if he lingers, and the strong
sensation of the possibility is upon him even though
he knows it cannot happen except by some extraordinary
accident. Edward put the letter where he
knew the butler would find it, and send it away for
the late post. It would thus be out of his power to
recall, even though a panic should seize him. When
he had done this, he felt an overwhelming need of
the fresh air and movement to calm his nerves and
distract his thoughts. Should he go to Ellen's folly
as was his custom? He put on his coat and went
out, forgetting that it was his usual custom to go up
stairs and say good-night to Catherine before doing
so. There was no intentional neglect in this, but
only the intensity of his abstraction and self-absorbedness.
When he got out the cold breeze in his face was
pleasant to him, brain and all. Then he remembered
that Hester had said she would not go to the Merridews,
and obeying his impulse without questioning
what he expected from it, he turned away from the
lights of the town, and took his way along the moonlit
road towards the Vernonry. He did not expect
to see her&mdash;he expected nothing in particular; but
his thoughts, his heart, drew him in that direction&mdash;or
his fancy, if nothing more.</p>

<p>Catherine, in the warmth and lonely luxury of
her drawing-room, heard the door shut, and wondered,
with a new little arrow of pain going into
her heart&mdash;Was it possible that he could have gone
out without saying good-night? She was like a
mother who is beginning to discover that she is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
no particular consequence in the economy of her
child's life. When you seize upon the office of
parent without being called to it by God, you must
accept the pains as well as the pleasures. This new
step in the severance between them hurt her more
than she could have thought possible; the merest
trifle! He might have forgotten; it might be fully
accounted for&mdash;and, if not, what did it matter? It
was nothing; but she stole behind the heavy curtains,
and looked out at the corner of the blind with
a wistful anxiety to see him, as if the sight of
him would afford any comfort. Had Edward seen
it he would have gnashed his teeth at her inquisition,
at her watch and surveillance, without a
thought of the trembling of profound tenderness,
surprise, and pain which was in her. But Catherine
was too late to see him. He had got into the
shadow of the great holly, and there paused a
moment before he turned his back upon Redborough
and the dance. She saw a solitary figure on the
road in the opposite direction, and wondered vaguely
who it could be at that hour, but that was all.
That it should be Edward did not enter into her
thoughts.</p>

<p>But to Edward the silence and stillness were very
grateful, emerging out of the very heat and din of
conflict as he had just done. The cold too did him
good; it refreshed his weary mind and excited brain,
and composed and stilled the ferment in his whole
being. The vast darkness of the world about him,
the broad white light of the moon streaming along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the road, but retiring baffled from the inequalities
of the common; the spectral outline of every object,
enlarged by the blackness behind of its own shadow&mdash;all
had a vague effect upon him, though he made
but little account of the features of the scene. He
was in a state of mental exaltation, and therefore
more open than usual to all influences, though it
was not any lofty or noble cause which raised him
into that spiritual susceptibility. He could see a
long way before he reached it, the end window of
Mrs. John's house shining along the road, its little
light looking like a faint little ruddy earth-star, so
near the ground. The mother and daughter were
still sitting over their fire, talking&mdash;or rather it was
the mother who talked, while Hester sat with her
hands in her lap, half-listening, half-thinking, her
mind escaping from her into many a dream and
speculation, even while she gave a certain attention
to her mother's broken monologue, which was chiefly
about the dances and parties of the past.</p>

<p>"I never refused a ball when I was your age,"
Mrs. John said. "It would have been thought quite
unnatural; and though I am old now, I feel the
same as ever. What can be nicer for a girl than to
have a nice dance to go to, when she is sure of
plenty of partners? If it was in a strange place, or
you did not know the people, I could understand.
It did hurt me a little, I confess, to hear that little
Emma, with her white eyes, rolling away like a
princess, to get all the attention, while my girl,
that had so much better a right, stayed at home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, mamma," said Hester, with a smile.
"It was my own fault; there was no wicked stepmother
in question. And even if there had been,
you know, after all, it was Cinderella that got the
prince."</p>

<p>"Stepmother!" cried Mrs. John. "My dear!
my dear! how could you have had a stepmother,
and me surviving your poor dear papa all these
years? I dare say if it had been me that died you
would have had a stepmother, for gentlemen don't
think of second marriages as women do. However,
as it could not have happened, we need not think of
that. Don't you hear steps on the road? I could
be almost certain that I heard some one pass the
window about five minutes ago; and there it is
again. Can there be anything wrong with the
Captain or old Mrs. Morgan? Dear me! what a
dreadful thing if they should be taken ill, and
nobody to send for the doctor! Listen! it is
coming back again. If it was some one going for
the doctor, they would not walk back and forward
like that under our window. I declare I begin to
get quite frightened. What do you think it can be?"</p>

<p>"If you think they may be ill I will run round
directly," said Hester, rising to her feet.</p>

<p>"But, my darling! it might be robbers, and not
Captain Morgan at all."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of robbers," said Hester, which
perhaps was not exactly true. "Besides, robbers
don't make a noise to scare you. I must go and see
if there is anything wrong."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. John did all she could at once to arouse her
daughter to anxiety about the old people, and to
persuade her that it was dangerous to run round the
corner at nearly eleven o'clock. But eventually she
consented to let Hester venture, she herself accompanying
her with a candle to the door.</p>

<p>"It will be far better, mamma," Hester said, "if
you will stand at the parlour window, and let me
feel there is some one there."</p>

<p>This Mrs. John, though with much trembling, at
length agreed to do. She even opened the window
a little, though very cautiously, that nobody might
hear, reflecting that if it was a robber he might jump
in before she could get it closed again. And her
anxiety rose almost to the fever point in the moments
that followed. For Hester did not pass the window
on her way to the Morgans' door. On the contrary,
Mrs. John heard voices in the direction of the gate
of the Heronry, and venturing to peep out, saw two
dark figures in the moonlight&mdash;a sight which alarmed
her beyond expression. It was nearly eleven o'clock,
and all the inmates of the Heronry were in bed or
going to it. Was it really robbers?&mdash;and why was
Hester parleying with them?&mdash;or were these two of
the robbers, and had they made away with her child?
She was so alarmed at last that she hurried to the
door, carrying her candle, and went out into the
cold without a shawl, shading the light with her
hand, and looking wildly about her. The candle and
the moonlight confused each other, and though her
heart beat less loudly when she perceived it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Hester who was talking across the gate, yet the sense
of the unusual filled her with horror. "Who is it?"
she cried, though in a whisper. "Hester! oh, what
is the matter? Is it a doctor? Who is it? Is there
anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"It is Edward Vernon; may he come in?" Hester
said.</p>

<p>"Then it is Catherine that is ill," cried Mrs. John.
"Oh, I knew something must be going to happen to
her, for I dreamt of her all last night, and I have not
been able to think of anything else all day. Surely
he may come in. What is it, Edward? Oh, I hope
not paralysis, or anything of that kind."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>A LATE VISITOR.</h3>


<p>He was not a frequent visitor: indeed it is doubtful
whether, save for a visit of ceremony, he had
ever been there before. As it was so near bedtime
the fire was low, and the two candles on the table
gave very little light in the dark wainscoted room.
Outside it had seemed a ruddy little star of domestic
comfort, but within the prospect was less cheerful.
They had been preparing to go to bed. Mrs. John's
work was carefully folded and put away, even the
little litter of thimbles and thread on the table had
been "tidied," as her usage was. A book lying
open, which was Hester's, was the only trace of
occupation, and the dark walls seemed to quench
and repel the little light, except in some polished
projection here and there where there was a sort of
reflection. Mrs. John hastily lit the two candles on
the mantelpiece which were always ready "in case
any one should come in," and which mirrored themselves
with a sort of astonishment in the little glass
against which they stood. She was eager to be
hospitable, although she had a somewhat warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
realisation of Edward as on the other side: perhaps,
indeed, this of itself made her more anxious to show
him "every attention," as a sort of magnanimous
way of showing that she bore no malice.</p>

<p>"It is rather too late to offer you tea," she said,
"but perhaps a glass of wine, Hester&mdash;for it is a
cold night and your cousin has had a long walk.
I am very much relieved to hear that Catherine is
quite well. For the first moment I confess I was
very much alarmed: for she has used her head a
great deal, and people say that paralysis&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think she is at all a subject for that: her
nerves are in perfect order," Edward said.</p>

<p>"That is a great thing to say for the strongest of
us," said Mrs. John, sitting down in her chair again
and furtively drawing her shawl round her; for he
could not surely mean to stay long at that hour, and
it seemed a pity to put more coals on the fire;
"nerves is the weak point with most ladies. I know
to be sure that Catherine is a very remarkable person,
and not at all like the ordinary run. She has a
masculine mind I have always heard. You are like
Hester, you are not at the ball to-night&mdash;but you go
generally, I hope?"</p>

<p>"I go sometimes; there was no particular attraction
to-night," said Edward.</p>

<p>He saw that Hester understood, and that the ready
colour rose to her face. How he longed to take the
little tedious mother by the shoulders and send her
up stairs! A sort of longing for sympathy, for some
one to share his second and hidden life with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
had seized upon him. He could not have told her
all, even if he could have got Hester to himself, but
he would have told her something, enough to keep
the too full cup from running over. But Mrs. John
settled herself as comfortably as she could in her
chair. She tried to keep awake and make conversation.
She would not allow one of the opposite
side to suppose that she was wanting in courtesy.
Hester sat down in the background and said nothing.
She did not share Edward's faith that her mother
would soon be tired out and leave them to themselves,
but it was impossible that she should not to
some extent share his excitement of suspense and
be anxious to know what he had to say.</p>

<p>"I like young men to go to balls," Mrs. John
said; "where could they be so well as amusing
themselves among their own kind of people? and
though perhaps Ellen may be a little silly,
you know, I am sure she means well. That is what
I always say to Hester. Young people are apt to
judge severely, but Ellen always meant well. She
might promise too much now and then, but so do
we all. It is so easy to make yourself agreeable by
just saying what will please; but then sometimes
it is very difficult to carry it out."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more true," said Edward, with
a little bow.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very true," continued Mrs. John. "It
seems all so easy at the moment: but afterwards
you have to take into consideration whether it is
suitable or not, and whether the person is just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
right kind, and to make everything fit: and all that
is so difficult." Then there was a little pause, and
Mrs. John began to feel very sleepy. "Do you often&mdash;take
a walk&mdash;so late?" she said. "Oh, I know
some gentlemen do. Hester's poor papa; but then
there was the club&mdash;I used always to think it was
the club&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed I ought to apologise for venturing to
ask admission at such an hour," said Edward. "I
should not have taken it upon me had not Hester
come out to the gate."</p>

<p>"Oh, that does not matter a bit," said Mrs. John,
waving her hand. She could scarcely keep her eyes
open. After eleven o'clock&mdash;for the hour had struck
since he came in&mdash;Catherine ought to have had "a
stroke" at least to justify such a late visit. "You are
sure you are not keeping anything from us about
poor dear Catherine?" she said anxiously. "Oh, I
think it is always better if there is any misfortune
to say it out at once."</p>

<p>Thus the conversation, if conversation it could be
called, went on for some time. Hester did not say
a word. She sat a little behind them, looking at
them, herself in a state of growing impatience and
suspense. What could he have to say that made
him come at such an hour&mdash;and was it possible that
he ever could get it said? There went on for some
time longer an interchange of hesitating remarks.
Mrs. John got more and more sleepy. Her eyes
closed in spite of herself when Edward spoke. She
opened them again widely when his voice stopped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and smiled and said something which was generally
wide of the mark. At last Hester rose and came
to the back of her chair and stooped over her.</p>

<p>"Mamma, you are very tired, don't you think you
had better go to bed?"</p>

<p>"I hope&mdash;" cried Edward, "I fear that my ill-timed
visit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not for the world, dear," said Mrs. John in an
undertone: "no doubt he'll be going presently.
Oh no, you must not think anything of the sort&mdash;we
often sit up much&mdash;later than this&mdash;" and she
sat very upright in her chair and opened her eyes
wide, determined to do her duty at all hazards.
Then Edward rose, and looked at Hester with an
entreaty which she could not resist. She was so
anxious too to know what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Don't come out, mother; I will open the door
for Edward," she said.</p>

<p>"But you don't know the right turn of the key.
Well then, perhaps&mdash;if your cousin will excuse me&mdash;but
be sure you lock the door right. It is a difficult
door. Put the key in as far as it will go&mdash;and then
turn it to the right. Let me see, is it the right?
I know it is the wrong way, not the way you
generally turn a key. Well then, good-night. I
hope you don't think it very uncivil of me to leave
you to Hester," Mrs. John said, shaking hands, with
that extremely wide-awake look which sleepy
persons put on.</p>

<p>Edward went out into the dark passages, following
Hester and her candle with a sense of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
that must be said to her now. He had not thought
of this when he set out. Then he had been merely
excited, glad of the relief of the air and silence,
scarcely aware that he wanted to pour out his soul into
the bosom of some one who would understand him,
of her who alone he thought could be trusted fully.
But the obstacles, the hindrances, had developed
this longing. Why should he have made so inappropriate
a visit except under the stimulus of having
something to say? And she, too, was now expecting
breathlessly, something which he must have to
say. When she set down her candle and opened
the door into the verandah, she turned round instinctively
to hear what it was. The white moon
shone down straight through the glass roof,
throwing black shadows of all the wintry plants in
the pots, and of the two who stood curiously
foreshortened by the light above them. She
did not ask anything, but her whole attitude was
a question. He took both her hands in his
hands.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said, "that is, I don't know
what there is to tell you. I had come to a conclusion,
after a great deal of thought. I had settled to
begin in a new way, and I felt that I must talk it
over, that I couldn't keep silent; and there is no
one I could speak to with freedom but you."</p>

<p>She did not withdraw her hands, or show any
surprise at his confidence; but only whispered
"What is it, Edward?" breathlessly, with all the
excitement that had been gathering in her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know how I can tell you," he said; "it is
only business. If I were to go into details you
wouldn't understand. It is only that I've made up
my mind to a new course of action. I am burning
my ships, Hester. I must get rid of this shut-up life
somehow. I have gone in to win&mdash;a great fortune&mdash;or
to lose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Edward!" she said, with an unconscious pressure
of his hands. "Tell me&mdash;I think I could
understand."</p>

<p>"So long as you feel with me, that is all I want,"
he said. "I feel better now that I have told you.
We shall make our fortune, dear, or&mdash;but there is no
or&mdash;we must succeed. I know we shall; and then,
Hester, my only love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew close to her, and kissed her in his excitement,
straining her hands. It was not a love-kiss,
but the expression of that agitation which was in his
veins. She drew back from him in astonishment,
but not in anger, understanding it so.</p>

<p>"What is it? To win a great fortune, or&mdash;to lose&mdash;what?
Edward, you are not risking&mdash;other
people?" she said.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he said, almost turning away from her.
Then, next moment, "Never mind other people,
Hester. That will come all right. I hope you don't
think I am a fool. I have made a new departure,
that is all, and with everything in my favour. Wish
me good luck, and keep my secret. It seemed too
big for me to keep all by myself. Now that I have
put half of it upon you I shall be able to sleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you have not told me anything," she
said.</p>

<p>Upon which he laughed a little, in an agitated
way, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is all the better. You know everything,
and yet you know nothing. I have been kept
in long enough, and done as other people would, not
as I wished myself; and now that is over. There is
no one in the world to whom I would say so much,
but you."</p>

<p>Hester was pleased and touched to the bottom of
her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could only help you!" she cried; "if I
could do anything, or if you would tell me more! I
know I could understand. But anyhow, if it is a
relief to you to tell me just as much as that; I am
glad! only if I could but help you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At present no one could help; it is fortune that
must decide."</p>

<p>"You mean Providence," said Hester, softly. She
had never used the phraseology of religious sentiment
as many girls do at her age, and was very shy in
respect to it. But she added, under her breath,
"And one can always pray."</p>

<p>At this Edward, which was a sign of grace in him,
though she did not know it as such, drew back with
a hasty movement. It gave him a strange sensation
to think of the success which he was seeking by such
means being prayed for, as if it had been a holy
enterprise. But just then Mrs. John stirred audibly
within, as if about to come and inquire into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
causes of the delay. He kissed her again tenderly,
without any resistance on her part, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-night&mdash;good-night! I must not say any
more."</p>

<p>Hester opened the outer door for him, letting in
the cold night air. It was a glorious night, still as
only winter is, the moonlight filling up everything.
She stood for a moment looking after him, as he
crossed the threshold. When he had made a few
steps into the night, he came back again hastily, and
caught her hands once more.</p>

<p>"Hester, we win or lose. Will you come away
with me? Will you give up all this for me? You
don't love it any more than I do. Will you come with
me and be free?"</p>

<p>"Edward, you don't think what you are saying.
You forget my mother," she said.</p>

<p>He gave an impatient stamp with his foot; contradiction
was intolerable to him, or any objection
at this moment. Then he called "Good-night,"
again, more loudly into the air, as though to reach
Mrs. John in the parlour, and hurried away.</p>

<p>"Edward was a long time saying good-night,"
said Mrs. John. "I suppose you were talking about
the ball; that is always what happens when you
give up a thing for a whim; you always regret it
after. Of course you would both have preferred to
be there. I suppose that is why he came in this
evening, a thing he never did in his life before.
Well, I must say we are all indebted, more or less, to
Ellen Merridew, Hester. She has drawn us together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in a way there never was any chance of in the old
times. Fancy Edward Vernon coming into our
house in that sort of unceremonious way! It was too
late. I would never encourage a gentleman to come
so late: but still it showed a friendly spirit, and a
confidence that he would be welcome, which is
always nice. I must tell him next time I see him
that I shall be delighted at any time to have him
here, only not quite so late at night."</p>

<p>"I dare say it will not happen again," Hester said.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't it happen again? It is the most
natural thing in the world; only I shall tell him
that usually we are all shut up by ten o'clock. It
did give me a great fright to begin with, for I
thought he must have come to tell us that Catherine
was ill. She has always been so strong and well
that I shouldn't wonder at all if it was something
sudden that carried her off in the end; and whenever
it does come it will be a great shock; besides that, it
will break up everything. This house will probably
be sold, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Catherine Vernon does not look at all like
dying," Hester said. "Please do not calculate upon
what would happen."</p>

<p>"My dear, it does not make a thing happen a day
the sooner that we take it into consideration; for we
will have to, when the time comes. We shall all
have to leave our houses, and it will make a great
deal of difference. Of course we can't expect her
heirs to do the same kind of thing as Catherine has
done. No, I confess that was what I thought, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was a great relief to me to hear&mdash;did you lock the
door, Hester? I hope you remembered to turn the
key the wrong way. The fire is quite safe, I think,
and I have shut the shutters. Carry the candle and
let us go to bed."</p>

<p>Mrs. John continued to talk while they were undressing,
though she had been so sleepy during
Edward's visit. She would permit no hasty manipulation
of Hester's hair, which had to be brushed
for twenty minutes every night. She thought its
beauty depended upon this manipulation, and never
allowed it to be omitted, and as this peaceful exercise
was gone through, and her mother's gentle commentary
ran on, it is impossible to describe the force of
repressed thought and desire for silence and quiet
which was in Hester's veins. She answered at
random when it was necessary to answer at all, but
Mrs. John took no notice. She had been roused up
by that curious visit. She took longer time than
usual for all her own little preparations, and was
more particular than usual about the hair-brushing.
The fire was cheerful in the outer room, which was
the mother's, and on account of this fire it was the
invariable custom that Hester should do her hair-brushing
there. Her mother even tried a new way
of arranging Hester's hair, so full was she of that
mental activity which so often adds to the pangs of
those who are going through a secret crisis. It
seemed hours before the girl was finally allowed to
put out the candle, and steal back into the cold
moonlight, into her own little room where the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
always stood open between her and her mother.
Hester would have liked to close that door; her
thoughts seemed too big, too tumultuous, not to
betray themselves. Soon, however, Mrs. John's calm,
regular breathing, showed her to be asleep, and then
Hester felt free to deliver herself up to that torrent
of thought.</p>

<p>Was it possible that not very long since she had
scorned herself for almost sharing Emma's ignoble
anxiety that he should "speak." It had chafed and
fretted her almost beyond endurance to feel herself
thus on the same level as Emma, obliged to wait till
he should declare his wishes, feeling herself so far
subordinate and dependent, an attitude which her
pride could not endure. Now he had spoken indeed&mdash;not
in the conventional way, saying he loved her
and asking her to marry him, as people did in books.
Edward had taken it for granted that she was well
aware of his love&mdash;how could it be otherwise? Had
not she known from the beginning, when their eyes
met, that there was an interchange in that glance
different from and more intimate than all the intercourse
she had ever had with others? Even when
she had been so angry with him, when he had passed
by her in Catherine Vernon's parties with but that
look, indignant as she had been, was there not something
said and replied to by their eyes such as had
never passed between her and any other all her life
long?&mdash;"My only love." She knew she was his
only love. The remembrance of the words made her
heart beat, but she felt now that she had known them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
all along. Since the first day when they met on the
common, she a child, he in the placidity of unawakened
life, there had been nobody to each but the
other. She knew and felt it clearly now&mdash;she had
known it and felt it all along, she said to herself&mdash;but
it had wanted that word to make it flash into
the light. And how unlike ordinary love-making it
all was! He had come to her, not out of any stupid
doubt about her response to him, not with any intention
of pleading his own cause, but only because
his burden was too much for him, his heart too full,
and she was the only one in all the world upon whom
to lean it. Hester said to herself, with fine scorn,
that to suppose the question, "Do you love me?" to
be foremost in a man's mind when he was fully immersed
in the business and anxieties of life, was to
make of love not a great but a petty thing. How
could he fail to know that as he had looked upon her
all those years so she had looked upon him? "My
only love"&mdash;the words were delightful, like music to
her ears; but still more musical was the thought
that he had come to her not to say them&mdash;that he
had come to lean upon her, upon her arm, and her
heart&mdash;to tell her that something had happened to
him which he could not tell to any one else in the
world. To think that he should have been drawn
out of his home, along the wintry road, out into the
night, solely on the hope of seeing her and reposing
his over-full mind upon her, conveyed to Hester's
soul a proud happiness, a sense of noble befittingness
and right, which was above all the usual pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
(she thought) of a newly disclosed love. He had
disclosed it in the noblest way, by knowing that it
needed no disclosure, by coming to her as the other
part of him when he was in utmost need. Had
Edward calculated deeply the way to move her he
could not have chosen better; but he did it instinctively,
which was better still&mdash;truly needing, as he
said, that outlet which only the most intimate unity
of being, the closest of human connections, could
give. Hester could think of nothing but this in the
first rapture. There were other things to be taken
into consideration&mdash;what the momentous step was
which he had taken, and what was the meaning of
that wild proposal at the end. To go away with him,
win or lose&mdash;&mdash; She would not spoil the first sweet
impression with any thought of these, but dropped
asleep at last, saying to herself "My only love" with
a thrill of happiness beyond all words. She had
believed she would not sleep at all, so overflowing
was her mind with subjects of thought, but these
words were a sort of lullaby which put the other
more important matters out of her head. "My only
love"&mdash;if it was he who had said them, or she who
had said them, she could scarcely tell. They expressed
everything&mdash;the meaning of so many silent
years.</p>

<p>Edward was making his way as quietly as possible
into the house which had been his home for so
many years, while Hester turned over these things
in her mind. He had loitered on the way back,
saying to himself that if Catherine should chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
not to be asleep, it was better that she should
suppose him to have gone to the Merridews. He
felt himself something like a thief in the night as
he went in, taking his candle and going softly up
the carpeted stairs not to disturb her&mdash;a proceeding
which was for his sake, not for hers, for he had no
desire to be questioned in the morning and forced to
tell petty lies, a thing he disliked, not so much for
the sake of the lies as for the pettiness of them.
But Catherine, disturbed by a new anxiety which
she did not understand, was lying awake, and did
hear him, cautious as he was. She said to herself,
"He has not stayed long to-night," with a sense
half of satisfaction, half of alarm. Never before
during all the years he had been under her roof had
this feeling of insecurity been in her mind before.
She did not understand it, and tried to put it aside
and take herself to task for a feeling which did
Edward injustice, good as he was, and had always
been, in his relations with her. If some youthful
tumult was in his mind, unsettling him, there was
nothing extraordinary in that&mdash;if he was "in love,"
that natural solution of youthful agitations. It is
common to say and think that mothers, and those
who stand in a mother's place, are jealous of a new comer,
and object to be no longer the first in their
child's affections. Catherine smiled in the dark, as
she lay watching and thinking. This should not
stand in Edward's way&mdash;provided that he made a
right choice! But whatever choice he made, it
would be for him, not her, she reflected, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
magnanimity almost beyond nature, and it would
be strange if she could not put up with it for his
sake. She had not, indeed, the smallest idea in
which direction his thoughts had turned. But
there was something in the air which communicated
alarm.</p>

<p>When Hester woke next morning, it was not with
the same sense of beatitude which had rapt her
from all other considerations on the previous night,
notwithstanding her high certainty that the mere
love declared was but secondary in her mind to the
noble necessity of having to share the burdens and
bear part in the anxieties of her lover. Everything
else he said had, in fact, been little to her in
comparison with the three words which had been
going through her mind and her dreams the whole
night, and which sprang to her lips in the morning
like an exquisite refrain of happiness, but which
gradually, as she began to think, went back out of
the foreground, leaving her subject to questions and
thoughts of a very different description. What had
the crisis been through which he had passed? What
was the new departure, the burning of the ships?
There must be some serious meaning in words so
serious as these. And then that wild suggestion
that she should fly with him, whether they gained
or lost, "away from all this; you don't love it any
more than I do"&mdash;what did that mean? Alarm was
in her mind along with the excitement of a secret
half-revealed. An eager and breathless longing to
see him again, to know what it meant, gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
possession of her mind. Then there floated back
into her ears Roland's remark, which had half-offended
her at the time, which she had thought
unnecessary, almost impertinent, that Edward "lost
his head." In what did he lose his head? She
remembered the whole conversation as her mind
went back to it. Edward was too hot and eager;
he had a keen eye, but he lost his head; he was
tired of the monotony of his present life. And
then there came his own statement about burning
his ships. What did it all mean? She began to
piece everything together, dimly, as she could with
her imperfect knowledge. She had no training in
business, and did not know in what way he could
risk in order to gain&mdash;though of course this was a
commonplace, and she had often heard before of
men who had lost everything or gained everything
in a day. But when Hester thought of the bank,
and of all the peaceable wealth with which Vernon's
was associated, and of the young men going to their
office tranquilly every day, and the quiet continual
progress of their affairs, she could not understand
how everything could hang upon a chance, how
fortune could be gained or lost in a moment. It was
scarcely more difficult to imagine the whole economy
of the world dropping out in a moment, the heavens
rolling up like a scroll, and the foundations of the
earth giving way, than to imagine all that long-established
framework of money-making collapsing
so that one of the chief workers in it could talk of
burning his ships and suggest a moment when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
should fly away from all this&mdash;which could only
mean from every established order of things. That
her heart should rise with the sense of danger, and
that she should be ready to give her anxious help
and sympathy and eager attention, to the mystery,
whatever it was, did not make any difference in
Hester's sudden anxiety and alarm. The earth
seemed to tremble under her feet. Her whole life
and the action of the world itself seemed to hang in
suspense. She did what she had never in her life
thought possible before. She went out early, pretending
some little business, and hung about on the
watch, with her veil down, and her mind in a tumult
impossible to describe, to meet Edward, if possible,
on his way to the bank. Could it be Hester, so
proud, so reserved as she was, that did this? Her
cheeks burned and her heart beat with shame: but
it seemed to her that she could not endure the
suspense, that she must see and question him, and
know what it was. But Edward had gone to the
bank earlier than usual, which was a relief as well
as a disappointment unspeakable to her. She stole
home, feeling herself the most shameless, the least
modest of girls; yet wondered whether she could
restrain herself and keep still, and not make another
effort to see him, for how could she live in this
suspense? Punishment came upon her, condign
and terrible. She fell into the hands of Emma
Ashton, who was taking a little walk along the
road in the morning, to wake her up a little, she
said, after the ball last night, and who, utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
unconscious of Hester's trouble and agitated looks,
had so many things to tell her, and turned back
with her, delighted to have a companion. "For
though a little exercise is certainly the best thing
for you, it is dull when you take it all by yourself,"
Emma said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>DOUBTS AND FEARS.</h3>


<p>The abruptness with which Edward Vernon
retired from the discussion with his partner and
agent had a singular effect upon both. Neither
accepted it as done in good faith. It surprised and
indeed startled them. What they had looked for
was a prolonged discussion, ending in all probability
in a victory for Edward, who was by far the most
tenacious of the three, and least likely to yield to
the others. So easy a conclusion of the subject
alarmed them more than the most obstinate maintenance
of his own views. They were so much
surprised indeed that they did not communicate
their astonishment to each other on the spot by
anything more than an interchange of looks, and
parted after a few bewildered remarks about nothing
in particular, neither of them venturing to begin
upon a subject so delicate. But when they next met
reflection had worked upon both. Neither had been
able to dismiss the matter from his thoughts. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
met indeed in a most inappropriate atmosphere for
any such grave discussion, at Ellen Merridew's house,
where they mutually contemplated each other from
opposite sides of the room, with an abstraction not
usual to either. It had a great effect upon both
of them, also, that neither Hester nor Edward
appeared. Roland had known beforehand and
reconciled himself as well as he could to the former
want: and Harry did not know it, and was full of
curious and jealous alarm on the subject, unable to
refrain from a suspicion that the two who were
absent must have somehow met and be spending
at least part of the time together free from all
inspection&mdash;a thing which was really happening,
though nothing could be more unlikely, more unprecedented
than that it should happen. Roland
did not think thus; he knew very well that Edward
had not attempted to hold any intercourse with
Hester, and felt that as far as this was concerned
there was no extra danger in the circumstances:
but Harry's alarm seemed to confirm all his own
ideas on the other matter. He missed Hester
greatly for his own part&mdash;not that he did not do his
best to make several of the Redborough young ladies
believe that to recall himself to her individual recollection
was the special object of his visit&mdash;but
that was a mere detail of ordinary existence. It
was Hester he had looked forward to as the charm
of the evening, and everything was insipid to him
without her, in the feminine society around him.
It was not till after supper, when the fun had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
become faster and more furious that he found himself
standing close to Harry whose countenance in the
midst of all this festivity was dull and lowering as a
wintry sky. Harry did not dance much; he was a
piece of still life more than anything else in his
sister's house: loyally present to stand by her, doing
everything she asked him, but otherwise enduring
rather than enjoying. This was not at all Roland's
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>: but on this special evening when they got
together after midnight the one was not much more
lively and exhilarating in aspect than the other.
They stood up together in a doorway, the privileged
retreat of such observers, and made some gloomy
remarks to each other. "Gets to look a little absurd,
don't it, this sort of thing, when you have a deal on
your mind?" Harry said out of his moustache.
And "Yes. Gaiety does get depressing after a
while," Roland remarked. After which they relapsed
again into dead silence standing side by side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ashton, what do you mean by it?" cried
Ellen. "I have given up Harry: but <i>you</i> usually
do your duty. Good gracious! I see <i>three</i> girls
not dancing, though I always have more men on
purpose. I don't know what you boys mean."</p>

<p>"Let us alone, Ashton and I, Nell&mdash;we've got
something to talk about," said Harry.</p>

<p>His sister looked up half alarmed in his face.</p>

<p>"I declare since you've gone so much into business
you're <i>insupportable</i>, Harry," she cried. It seemed
to bring the two men a little closer to each other
when she whisked off again into the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's quite true," said Harry, "let's go into the
hall, where there's a little quiet. I do want awfully
to talk to you. What do you think about Ned
giving up that business all at once, when we both
stood up to him about it? I was awfully grateful
to you for standing by me. I scarcely expected it;
but as for Ned giving in like that, I can scarcely
believe it even now."</p>

<p>"It was not much like him, it must be confessed,"
Roland said.</p>

<p>"Like him! he never did such a thing in his life
before; generally he doesn't even pay much attention
to what one says. He has a way of just facing you
down however you may argue, with a sort of a smile
which makes me fit to dance with rage sometimes.
But to-day he was as meek as Moses&mdash;What do you
think? I&mdash;don't half like it, for my part."</p>

<p>"You think after all he was in the right
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I never could do that. To risk
other people in that way is what I never would
consent to. But a fellow who is so full of fight and
so obstinate, to give in&mdash;that's what I don't
understand."</p>

<p>"You think perhaps&mdash;he has not given in," Roland
said.</p>

<p>Harry gave him a bewildered look, half grateful,
half angry. "Now I wonder what I've said that
has made you think that!"</p>

<p>"Nothing that you have said&mdash;perhaps only an
uneasy feeling in my own mind that it isn't natural,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and that I don't understand it any more than
you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harry, with a long breath of relief,
"that is just what I think. I don't believe for a
moment, you understand, that Ned, who is a real
good fellow all through"&mdash;here he made a slight
pause, and glanced at Roland with a sort of defiance,
as if expecting a doubt, which however was not
expressed&mdash;"means anything underhand, you know.
Of <i>course</i> I don't mean that. But when a man
knows that he is cleverer than another fellow, he'll
just shut up sometimes and take his own way,
feeling it's no use to argue&mdash;I don't mean he thinks
himself cleverer than you, Ashton; that's a different
affair. But he hasn't much opinion of me. And
in most things no doubt he's right, and I've never
set up to have much of an opinion."</p>

<p>"There you are wrong, Vernon," said Roland,
"you have the better judgment of the two. Edward
may be cleverer as you say, but I'd rather throw in
my lot with you."</p>

<p>"Do you really say so?" cried Harry, lighting up;
"well, that is very kind of you anyhow. My only
principle is we've got others to consider besides
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Precisely so," said Roland, who had heard this
statement already, "and you were quite right to
stick to it: but I confess I am like you, not quite
comfortable about the other matter. Has he means
enough of his own to go in for it? If so, I should
think that was what he intended."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry shook his head. "We had none of us any
means," he said. "Aunt Catherine took us, as you
might say, off the streets. We were not even very
near relations. She's done everything for us: that's
why I say doubly, don't let us risk a penny of her
money or of what she prizes above money. You may
think we were not very grateful to her," Harry
continued, "but that's only Ellen's way of talking.
If there was anything to be done for Aunt Catherine
that little thing has got as true a heart as any one.
But we were not wanted, as you may say. Ned was
always the favourite, and so Nell set up a little in
opposition, but never meaning any harm."</p>

<p>"I feel sure of that," said Roland, with a warmer
impulse than perhaps Mrs. Ellen in her own person
would have moved him to. And then he added, after
a pause, "I think I'll open the subject again. If
Edward Vernon means to do anything rash, it's better
he should be in my hands than in some, perhaps,
that might be less scrupulous. I'll see him to-morrow
about it. There's no time lost, at least&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's capital!" cried Harry, warmly; "that's
exactly what I wanted. I didn't like to ask you;
but that's acting like a true friend: and if, as a
private person, there's anything I could do to back
him up&mdash;only not to touch Vernon's, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their privacy was broken in upon by the swarm
of dancers pouring into the coolness of the hall as
the dance ended; but up to the moment when the
assembly broke up Harry continued, by an occasional
meaning look now and then across the heads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
others, to convey his cheerful confidence in Roland,
and assurance that now all would go well. Ashton,
too, had in himself a certain conviction that it must
be so. He was not quite so cheerful as Harry, for
the kind of operations into which Edward's proposal
might bring him were not to his fancy. But the
very solemn charge laid upon him by the old people
had never faded from his memory, and Catherine
Vernon in herself had made a warm impression upon
him. He had been received here as into a new home&mdash;he
who knew no home at all; everybody had been
kind to him. He had met here the one girl whom,
if he could ever make up his mind to marry (which
was doubtful), he would marry. Everything combined
to endear Redborough to him. He had an
inclination even (which is saying a great deal) to
sacrifice himself in some small degree in order to
save a heartbreak, a possible scandal in this cheerful
and peaceful place. Edward Vernon, indeed, in
himself was neither cheerful nor peaceable; but he
was important to the preservation of happiness and
comfort here. Therefore Roland's resolution was
taken. He had come on purpose to dissuade and
prevent; he made up his mind now to further, and
secure the management of this over-bold venture,
since no better might be. He knew nothing, nor did
any but the writer of it know anything, of the letter
which Catherine Vernon's butler had carefully
deposited in the postbag, and sent into Redborough
an hour or two before this conversation, to be despatched
by the night mail. The night express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
from the north called at Redborough station about
midnight, and many people liked to travel by it,
arriving in town in the morning for their day's
business, not much the worse if they had good
nerves&mdash;for there was only one good train in
the day.</p>

<p>Next morning, accordingly, just after Hester had
returned with Emma from that guilty and agitated
walk, which she had taken with the hope of meeting
Edward, and hearing something from him about his
mysterious communication of the previous night&mdash;Roland
too set out with much the same purpose,
with a grave sense of embarking on an enterprise
he did not see the end of. He met the two girls
returning, and stopped to speak to them.</p>

<p>"Hester has been at Redborough this morning
already," Emma said. "I tell her she should have
been at Mrs. Merridew's last night, Roland. It was
a very nice dance&mdash;the very nicest of all, I think;
but perhaps that is because I am so soon going
away. A regular thing is so nice&mdash;always something
to look forward to; and you get to know
everybody, and who suits your steps best, and all
that. I have enjoyed it so very much. It is not
like town, to be sure, but it is so friendly and
homely. I shall miss it above everything when I
go away."</p>

<p>"It was unkind not to come last night, my only
chance," said Roland. He had no conception that
Hester could have the smallest share in the grave
business of which his mind was full, and, grave as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
it was, his mind was never too deeply engaged in
anything for this lighter play of eye and voice. She
seemed to wake up from a sort of abstraction, which
Emma's prattle had not disturbed, when he spoke,
and blushed with evident excitement under his
glance. There was in her, too, a sort of consciousness,
almost of guilt, which he could not understand.
"I hope you were sorry," he added, "and were not
more agreeably occupied: which would be an additional
unkindness."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can't say I am sorry."</p>

<p>Her colour varied; her eyes fell. She was not
the same Hester she had been even last night;
something had happened to the girl. It flashed
across his mind for the moment that Edward had
been absent too, which gave a sting of pique and
jealousy to his thoughts: but reassured himself,
remembering that these two never met except at
the Merridews. Where could they meet? Edward,
who conformed to all Catherine Vernon's ways,
though with resentment and repugnance, and
Hester, who would conform to none of them. He
was glad to remind himself of this as he walked on,
disturbed by her look, in which there seemed so
much that had not been there before. She seemed
even to have some insight into his own meaning&mdash;some
sort of knowledge of his errand, which it was
simply impossible she could have. He told himself
that his imagination was too lively, that this little
society, so brimful of individual interests, with its
hidden motives and projects, was getting too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
for him. He had not been in the habit of pausing
to ask what So-and-So was thinking of, what that
look or this meant. In ordinary society it is enough
to know what people say and do; when you begin
to investigate their motives it is a sign that something
is going wrong. The next thing to do would
be to settle down among them, and become one of
the Redborough coterie, to which suggestion Roland,
with a slight shiver, said Heaven forbid! No, he
had not come to that point. Town and freedom
were more dear to him than anything he could find
here. Hester, indeed (if he was sure he could afford
it), might be a temptation; but Hester by no means
meant Redborough. She would not cling to the
place which had not been very gracious to her.
But he could not afford it, he said to himself,
peremptorily, as he went on. It was not a thing
to be thought of. A young man making his way in
the world, living, as yet a bachelor life, may have a
little house at Kilburn with his sister; but that
would not at all please him with a wife. And
Hester meant her mother as well. It was out of
the question; it was not to be thought of. But
why did she look so strangely conscious? why was
she so pale, so red, so full of abstraction and agitation
to-day? If anything connected with himself
could have caused that agitation, Roland could not
answer for it what he might be led to do.</p>

<p>This thought disturbed him considerably from the
other and graver thoughts with which he had started;
but he walked on steadily all the same to the bank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and knocked at the door of Edward's room. Edward
was seated at his table reading the morning's letters
with all the calm of a reasonable and moderate man
of business&mdash;a model banker, with the credit and
comfort of other men in his hands. He looked up
with a smile of sober friendliness, and held out his
hand to his visitor. He did not pretend to be
delighted to see him. The slightest, the very most
minute shadow of a consciousness that this was
not an hour for a visitor, was on his tranquil
countenance.</p>

<p>"You man of pleasure," he said, "after your late
hours and your dances, how do you manage to find
your way into the haunts of business at this time in
the morning!" and he glanced almost imperceptibly
at his letters as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am in no hurry," said Roland. "Read
your letters. You know I have nothing particular
to do here. I can wait your leisure; but I have
something to say to you, Vernon, if you will let me."</p>

<p>"My letters are not important. Of course I will
let you. I am quite at your disposal," Edward said;
but there was still a shade of annoyance&mdash;weariness&mdash;as
at a person importunate who would not take
a hint and convey himself away.</p>

<p>"I wanted to speak to you about the subject of
our conversation yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes, which was that?"</p>

<p>"It was important enough to have remained in
my memory," said Roland, with a little offence,
feeling himself put in the wrong from the beginning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
"I mean the proposals we were discussing&mdash;your
ideas on the subject of the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>that</i>! but you put a stop to all my ideas,
Harry and you in your wisdom. I thought you
must have meant that little matter about Aunt
Catherine's books. Yes, it seemed to me, so far
as my lights went, that the proposals were very
promising: and I might have stood out against
Harry, who will never set the Thames on fire; till
you came down upon me with your heavy guns&mdash;you
whom I expected to be on my side."</p>

<p>"Then you have really given it up?" cried
Roland, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Didn't you mean me to do so? That is what
I thought, at all events. You were so determined
about it, that I really don't see what else I could
have done, unless," he said, with a smile, "I had
been a capitalist, and completely independent, as
you said."</p>

<p>"I am most thankful to hear it, Vernon. I had
not been able to divest myself of the idea that you
were still hankering after it," said Roland; "and
I came, intending to say to you, that if your heart
was really set upon it&mdash;rather than that you
should put yourself into hands, perhaps not so
scrupulous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I see: rather than that a rival should get
the business&mdash;let us speak plainly," said Edward,
with a pale smile.</p>

<p>"That is not speaking plainly. It is altogether
different from my meaning; but take it so, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
please. I am glad to know that there is no necessity
for my intrusion anyhow," Roland said; and then
there was a little pause.</p>

<p>At last Edward got up, and came forward, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>"Pardon the little spite that made me put so
false an interpretation on your motive, Ashton.
I know that was not what you meant. I was
annoyed, I confess, that you did thwart me yesterday
in a matter I had so much at heart."</p>

<p>"I felt that you were annoyed; but what could
I do? I can only advise according to my judgment.
Anyhow, Vernon, I came here intending to say,
'Let me do the best I can for you if you persist;
don't throw yourself among those who promote that
kind of speculation, for they are not to be trusted
to.' But I am above measure glad to find that you
have no hankering after it. That is far the best
solution. You take a weight off my mind," Roland
said.</p>

<p>Edward did not answer for the moment. He
went back and reseated himself at his table. When
he showed his face again, Roland saw he was
laughing.</p>

<p>"After all you said to me yesterday, and Harry!
think of Harry's grand argument coming down upon
me like a sledge-hammer, as potent, and alas, quite
as heavy&mdash;how could you think it possible that
I should persist? I am not such a determined
character. Besides, don't you know I have never
been trained to act for myself?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>His laugh, his look, were not very convincing, but
at all events they were conclusive. After another
pause, Roland rose.</p>

<p>"I am interfering with your work," he said. "I
thought it my duty to come at once; but now that
it's all over, I must not waste your time. Pardon
my officiousness."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," said Edward, smiling cheerfully;
"the kindest feeling. I know it is. Are you
going to see Harry? He is in his room, I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I'll just speak to him. There is
some football match that Emma wants to see."</p>

<p>"More pleasuring," said Edward, and laughed
again. There was in him such an air of having
found his visitor out, that Roland could not divest
himself of a certain embarrassment. Edward, he
felt, knew as well as he did, that he was going to
report his failure to Harry. It fretted him beyond
description to be thus seen through, he, who had
thought himself so much more than a match for any
provincial fellow of them all. "But you are quite
right to consult Harry about football; he is the
greatest possible authority upon that subject,"
Edward said.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not of the slightest importance; it
is merely that Emma, who does not really care a
straw for football, and only wants something to
do, or see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is surely reason enough," said Edward, and
his complaisance went so far that he left his papers
again, and led the way to Harry's room, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
looked in, saying, "Here's Ashton come to inquire
about that match."</p>

<p>"Eh? Match?" cried Harry, in much surprise.
Then his faculties kindled at the sight of Roland's
face. "Will you play for us, Ashton? I didn't
know you went in for football. I just wanted a
man to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was for Emma; your sister told her she must
go and see it."</p>

<p>"I'll leave you to your explanations," said Edward,
with a laugh of triumph. And indeed the two conspirators
looked at each other somewhat crestfallen,
when he had gone away.</p>

<p>"He takes it quite lightly," said Roland, with the
sense of talking under his breath, "as if he had
never thought of the matter again&mdash;does not conceal
that he was vexed, but says of course there was an end
when I came down upon him with my heavy guns."</p>

<p>Then they looked at each other guiltily&mdash;ashamed,
though there was nothing to be ashamed of, like
plotters found out.</p>

<p>"Well, that's something tided over," Harry said.</p>

<p>"I hope so: but I must not stay, to confirm his
suspicions. Tell me when the match is for Emma,
for she does want to go and see it, that's quite true."</p>

<p>"I don't care for girls about," said Harry; "they
never understand the game, and it makes fellows
nervous. It's on Saturday, if she wants to come."</p>

<p>"I'll tell her it makes fellows nervous," said
Roland, as he went away. He said it in a louder
tone than usual, that he might be heard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Edward's room, and then despised himself for
doing so. Altogether he had seldom felt more small
or more completely baffled and seen through than
when he retired from those doors which he had
entered with so kind a purpose. It is embarrassing
to have the tables turned upon you, even in the
smallest matters. He felt that he had been made
to appear officious, intrusive, deceitful, even to himself,
making up plots with one man against another,
prying into that other's purposes, attributing falsehood
to him. This was how his generous intention
was cast back upon his hands. He tried to smile
cynically, and to point out to himself the foolishness
of straining to do a good action; but he was not a
cynic by nature, and the effort was not successful.
In any way, however, in which it could be contemplated,
it was evident that all had been done
that it was possible to do. If Edward had made up
his mind to the risk, he could not stand between
him and ruin. The matter was taken entirely out
of his hands.</p>

<p>Edward, for his part, returned to his room, and
shut himself in with feelings much less victorious
than those he made apparent. The excitement of
the great decision had a little failed and gone off.
He was in the chill reactionary stage, wondering
what might befall, feeling the tugs of old prejudice,
of all the traditions of honour in which he had been
brought up, dragging at his heart. No man brought
up as Edward had been could be without prejudices
on the side of right. It alarmed and wounded him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to-day to think that he had last night considered
the property of the bank and its customers as a
foundation upon which to start his own venture.
The sophisms with which he had blinded himself
in his excitement failed him now&mdash;the daylight was
too clear for them. He perceived that it was other
people's goods, other people's money, which he was
risking; that even to take them out, to look at
them, to think of them as in his power, was a
transgression of the laws of honour. Those chill
drawings back of customary virtue, of the prejudices
of honour, from the quick march of passion which
had hurried him past every landmark in that haste
to be rich, which would see no obstacle in its way,
plunged Edward into painful discouragement. He
seemed to himself to have fallen down from a
height, at which he had been master of his fate,
to some deep-lying underground where he was its
slave, and could only wait till the iron car of necessity
rolled on and crushed him. He had set, he
felt, machinery in motion which he could not stop,
which might destroy him. He sat and looked out
affrighted upon all the uncomprehended forces which
seemed to have got into movement against him.
He, a poor adventurer, with nothing that was his
own, to thrust himself into the midst of the commercial
movements in London, which nobody out
of them could understand fully; he to risk thousands
who had nothing; he to "go in to win" who had
nothing to stand upon! He saw all round him, not
only destruction, not only ruin, but contempt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
outrage. He had once seen a miserable "welsher"
hunted from a racecourse, and the spectacle, so cruel,
so barbarous, yet not unjust, came back to his mind
with a horrible fascination. He remembered the
poor wretch's hat battered down upon his head,
blinding him&mdash;the clothes torn from his back, the
cruelty with which he was pursued, and still more,
the mud and dirt, that meant not only punishment
but unutterable contempt. Under that recollection
Edward sat shivering. What was he better than
the welsher? Though he sat there, to all appearance,
spruce and cool, reading his morning's letters, he
was already in this state of miserable depression and
terror when Roland came in. The post that morning
had brought him no fresh alarm, no new excitement.
He was safe for that day; nothing could yet have
been done in his affairs that was not remediable.
It was possible even that by telegraphing now he
could stop all those horrible wheels of destiny, and
undo the decision of last night. As a matter of
fact, no intention of doing so was in his mind; but
the idea came uppermost now and then in the
boiling up and ferment within him: to stop everything
still, to relapse into the Edward of three
months ago&mdash;submissive, respectable, keeping every
punctilio of the domestic laws, as well as those of
recognised honesty and prudence. But he never
meant it; he was alarmed at himself, shaken out of
all that ease which excitement gives, that possibility
of believing what we wish; but though everything
that last night pointed to success seemed now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
point to despair, he felt himself clinging on to the
chance with desperation commensurate with the
gloomy prospect. Whatever it was to lead to, he
must yet go on. After all, prudence itself sometimes
fared as badly as hardihood. An investment that
had been calculated upon as the surest and safest
would sometimes turn out disastrous. Who could
tell? The chances of money were beyond all calculation.
And, after all, no one could say that the
ruin of the bank would be for his good. It would
be ruin to himself. It was not a thing that anybody
could suppose he would risk without deliberation.</p>

<p>He was in this condition, surging and seething,
when Roland visited him, and brought him suddenly
to himself with the force which an encounter with
the world outside so often gives to a struggling
spirit. He felt, with a wonderful sense of self-satisfaction,
that he was equal to the emergency,
and confronted it with a sudden gain of calm and
strength which seemed to him almost miraculous,
like what men engaged in holy work are justified
in considering help from above. It could not be
help from above which supplied Edward with self-possession
and strength for his first steps in the
career of evil, but still the relief was great. He got
the better of Roland, he extinguished the little
virtuous plot which he divined between him and
Harry, and he returned to his room with a smile
on his face. But once back again there he did not
feel triumphant. He felt that he was not trusted&mdash;that
already they suspected him of having broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
loose from their society and acting for himself. He
said to himself angrily that but for this he would
probably have telegraphed to contradict that momentous
letter of last night. But how could he do
it now? it would be pandering to their prejudices,
owning that he had taken an unjustifiable step.
And how was it unjustifiable? Was it not he who
was the virtual head, upon whose judgment and
insight everything depended? Supposing Catherine
to be consulted, as had ceased to be the case for
some time, partly with, partly against, her own will&mdash;but
supposing her to be consulted now, would
not she certainly give her adherence to Edward's
judgment rather than Harry's? It was not a question
there could be a moment's doubt about. She
would shake her head, and say, "You are far more
venturesome than ever I was, but if Edward really
thinks&mdash;&mdash;" Was not that always what she had
said? And ten years of experience had given him a
right to be trusted. He was acting for the best; he
looked for nothing but success. It was nerves, mere
nerves that had affected him&mdash;a reaction from the
excitement of last night.</p>

<p>And thus everything settled down. When he had
got over it, Edward was the most serene of all the
doubtful group which surrounded him, not knowing
what to make of him. Harry, who took a matter-of-fact
view, came next. He now thought it highly
probable, on the whole, that his cousin had thought
better of it. How could he do anything else?&mdash;he
had not means of his own to risk to such an extent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
which was a thought very satisfactory to Harry.
Roland Ashton was as much dissatisfied as men
usually are who endeavour in vain to see into the
minds of their neighbours, and offer good offices
which are not wanted. But the most uneasy of
all was Hester, who that day, for the first time,
took upon her the most painful burden of women&mdash;the
half knowledge which is torture, which the
imagination endeavours to supplement in a thousand
unreal ways, knowing them to be unreal, and dismissing
them as quickly as they are formed&mdash;and
the bitter suspense, the sensation that at any moment
things may be happening, news coming which will
bring triumph or misery, but which you cannot foresee
or accelerate, or do anything but wait for. She
did her best to pray, poor girl! breathing broken
petitions for she knew not what, as she went about
her little occupations all that lingering day. Surely
he would try to see her again, to satisfy her, and tell
what it was he had done, and how it could be possible,
winning or losing, to fly, as he had suggested,
from everything here. To fly&mdash;how could it be?
Why should it be? All the other mysteries came in
that to wonder unspeakable and dismay.</p>

<h3>A DISCOVERY.</h3>


<p>There was a dinner-party that evening at the
Grange. It was given on account of Ashton, now well
known in Redborough; and Catherine Vernon had
taken the trouble to go herself to beg Captain
Morgan to be of the party: but the old man had
refused steadily.</p>

<p>"I will have none of your fine company," he said.
"No, no; you do enough for me here. When you
come to see us it always is a pleasure, both to my old
woman and me: but a dinner, no. I have not had
on my evening coat this dozen of years. It's not
likely it would be in the fashion now."</p>

<p>"What does it matter about fashion? You shall
come as you are if you would like that better,"
Catherine said; but she did not mean it, and of
that they were all perfectly aware. "It is to do
honour to Roland. You are no longer so anxious
to separate yourself from Roland as when he came
here first," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man did not say anything, but his wife
answered for him.</p>

<p>"We will not commit ourselves, Catherine, you
know our way; but we think the boy does us credit.
I think it might be that if we were left to ourselves
we might even do a little match-making for him if
we could."</p>

<p>"Are you come to that?" said Catherine: but
there was an echo of a sigh in her voice. "That
seems to me to mean a confession&mdash;that we are not
enough for them any longer, but still that we will
not give in; we will be enough for them in another
way."</p>

<p>"Why should we be enough for them? We could
not think that was possible, living far off as we do,
and in a different way. No, but out of pure love,
which is just as foolish as anything else. I am the
wisest in this respect, for I know it will not do."</p>

<p>"And who is the lady?" Catherine asked with a
smile.</p>

<p>The next moment she saw very well who it was,
for they did not make her any reply. Old Mrs.
Morgan folding her hands said quietly, "It will
never answer," and the captain, leaving the mantelpiece
against which he had been leaning with his
face fully presented to her questioning, went and sat
down in his usual place near the window, which
afforded no such facilities to a penetrating eye.
They did not mean to tell her, and she knew.
She laughed to carry off the little annoyance with
which this preference and prejudice, as she called it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
always moved her, and said, "You should exert
yourself in his sister's favour; by all she tells me she
would not be ungrateful," in a way which communicated
the annoyance she felt back again to her
friends.</p>

<p>"We will not meddle with Emma," said old Mrs.
Morgan. "I am tempted to think sometimes that
the blood gets thin in a race when it runs too long,
like the last cup of my tea&mdash;which he says is just
hot water."</p>

<p>"Not so, not so," said old Captain Morgan. "You
are growing a materialist in your old age; that is
sometimes just the very essence and cream of all. In
story-books, when there are an old couple left like
you and me, the last child left with them to make
them happy is a creature that is perfect."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is heresy indeed," cried Catherine. "I
will not have you compare Emma to your last cup of
tea. There is nobody I meet with so original; and
is she to stay longer and have her chance? or has
she come to the height of her desires and persuaded
the gentleman to speak&mdash;there is nothing I want so
much to know."</p>

<p>But here Catherine became vaguely sensible of a
sentiment which, according to their own account,
had died out long ago in these old people. They
had declared themselves above prejudice in respect
to their own flesh and blood. The captain indeed
had thrown off all responsibility, and announced at
Roland's first coming that he was not prepared to
answer for him: and Emma had not been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
congenial to them as Roland. Notwithstanding, when
their grandchild was thus freely criticised it galled
them both. The old lady betrayed a little rising
colour of vexation and shame, and Captain Morgan
got up again restlessly and went and stood against
the window, shutting out half the light, and turning
his back&mdash;which was a very strong step, though but
for a moment&mdash;upon his guest.</p>

<p>"She has not been brought up like other girls,"
said Mrs. Morgan. "Perhaps it was none of our
duty; it is hard to say. We knew nothing of her:
poor little motherless thing, we might have brought
her away with us; but these are all questions it is
little use going into now. Such as she is, she is a
good girl in her way. When she is married, for she
will be sure to marry, she will make a good, careful
wife."</p>

<p>"One would think I had been saying harm of
Emma," cried Catherine, with some quickness; "when
the fact is I am one of those that like her most.
She is the most piquant variety of her species.
There is nobody that amuses me so much. She
knows what she wants, which so few do, and she
means to have it. She is quite honest and straight-forward.
You do me injustice in this."</p>

<p>There was nothing said in reply, and Catherine
did not like the position. Perhaps the universal
submission to which she was accustomed had spoilt
her, though she was so sure of seeing through it.
She got up to go away.</p>

<p>"I must do without you then, uncle, if I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
to have you; though I think it is a little hard upon
me&mdash;and upon Roland too."</p>

<p>"We are always here when you want us, Catherine;
as much as is in us is always at your service.
It is not much," said the old man, hobbling after her
to the door; "but your fine house and your fine
people are not in <i>her</i> way nor in mine. And what
should I do going back to the world, and <i>her</i> in the
arm-chair? You see yourself that would never do."</p>

<p>"It would delight her!" said Catherine, pausing
at the door; "you know that. Fancy her keeping
you by her because she is not able to go out too!
It almost looks as if&mdash;but that is impossible&mdash;you
did not understand a woman yet."</p>

<p>The old captain laughed and shook his white
head.</p>

<p>"Persuade yourself that!" he said; "make yourself
think that: that will chime in with the general
opinion, Catherine. If I were an old man on the
stage I would say, there's no understanding women.
If I don't understand her and all her ways, I am a
sillier old blockhead than you think."</p>

<p>"Then you know that what I say is true&mdash;that
she would like you to come&mdash;that it would please
her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it is she that is the silly old woman that
does not understand her old man," Captain Morgan
said.</p>

<p>Catherine left them with the impression that they
were in a mood beyond her comprehension. It was
a fine, clear, almost warm day, and the roads dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and walking pleasant. She had come on foot, as
was not very usual with her, and meant to walk
home. She set out on her return waving her hand
to Mrs. Morgan, but in no very cheerful frame of
mind. She had not been cheerful when she left
home. Her mind misgave her as it had not done
before for more years than she could count. What was
the reason she could scarcely tell. Edward was not
really less kind, less observant of her comfort. The
change she saw in him was one indescribable, which
no one else would have suspected, which in all
probability existed in her imagination alone. Why
should she suppose evils that had no existence?
There was no one like him, no son so dutiful to
his mother, no one so ready to make any sacrifice
for the pleasure of his home. If his looks had been
a little abstracted lately, if he had spent his time
away from her, if his work in his own room, which
she had made so comfortable for him, which she had
been so anxious to assure him the exclusive proprietorship
of, had increased of late, perhaps this
was merely the natural course of events. Or if he
had fallen in love&mdash;what then? Did the boy perhaps
think that she would be jealous and stand in
the way of his happiness? How little he knew!
Provided only his choice was a right one; she would
open her arms and her heart. She would be ready
to do anything for their comfort. There was no
sacrifice she would not gladly make. Notwithstanding
that somewhat nonsensical mystical flourish of
the old captain's about his understanding of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
wife, Catherine believed, and with much show of
truth, that men rarely understood women, and never
knew how ready they were to arrange everything, to
give up everything for the comfort and pleasure of
those they loved. What a welcome she would
herself give to Edward's wife, though he was
trembling and putting off and afraid to tell her!
What a reception that young woman should have!
Provided always&mdash;but with Edward's good taste
and good sense how could he go wrong in such a
choice?</p>

<p>It was at this moment that a shuffling light step
became audible, hurrying along the road, and a voice
calling "Catherine&mdash;is it really Catherine?" followed
by another step and another voice, with a
fainter sound in the repetition, but also calling upon
"Catherine!" Catherine Vernon paused and looked
round, her face losing its gravity and brightening
into its usual humorous look of half-contemptuous
toleration.</p>

<p>"It is Catherine!" cried Miss Vernon-Ridgway;
"I told you so. Dear Catherine, isn't this long walk
too much for you, and on such a cold day? Take
my arm&mdash;please take my arm: or won't you come
back to our little house and rest, and we'll send for
the carriage? It is a long walk for us who are not
used to luxury, and what must it be to you?"</p>

<p>It was true that the Miss Vernon-Ridgways were
under fifty, and Catherine was sixty-five; but she
was far more vigorous than they were, and more
capable of exercise. She turned round upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
smiling, but kept her arms close by her side, and
refused any support.</p>

<p>"I assure you," she said, "I am quite capable of
walking. You know I have always been accustomed
to exercise."</p>

<p>"Ah yes," said the sisters, "you were brought up
sensibly, dear Catherine, not spoiled darlings as we
were. We have never quite got over it, though we
should have known better long ago, if experience
was all: no one can tell how we miss our carriage;
and when we see you on foot, who can command
every ease, it quite wounds our feelings," said Miss
Martha, coming in at the end in a little provocation
by herself.</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you: but it does not at all
hurt my feelings. This is a fine day for a walk,
and I hope you are enjoying yours, as I do," said
Catherine, with her laughing look.</p>

<p>They both shook their heads.</p>

<p>"We do what we have to do, and I hope we don't
complain. But I declare I feel hurt that you should
have been at the Heronry and not paid us a visit.
I wish not to be jealous. You were no doubt talking
things over with Mrs. John?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing that there is to talk over with
Mrs. John," said Catherine, tartly. "I was visiting
my old uncle, which is a duty I never like to neglect."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said one sister, and "Ah!" said the other.
Then they cried eagerly each to each, "I knew it
was a vile story. Of course we have been
misinformed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was there to be misinformed about?" said
Catherine; then as she looked from one to another,
a sensation of coming trouble shot across her. "And
what," she added with a smile not so easy as the former
one, "am I supposed to have to say to Mrs. John?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was all an accident of course," said Miss
Matilda. "But you might tell Catherine all the
same. It is best that people should know; and
then they know what steps to take," said Miss
Martha. "To be sure Catherine would know what
steps to take," Matilda added again.</p>

<p>"This may all be very amusing," said Catherine,
"but as I don't know the word of the puzzle, I don't
see the joke, you know. One would think something
had happened in which I was concerned."</p>

<p>"I am not sure if you would think anything had
happened. Oh yes, I am sure we thought so last
night," cried the sisters one after another. "You see
the least little thing looks important when you are
going to bed&mdash;after eleven o'clock at night."</p>

<p>"What was this great event?" said Catherine,
with a certain sternness in her tone.</p>

<p>There was a great flutter of nods and looks
between the sisters. They came close to her, one
on either side, and Miss Matilda, always the boldest,
put a hand to Catherine's elbow by way of supporting
her if support were needed.</p>

<p>"Dear Catherine, do turn back with us to our
little place! it is close by, and we can give you
an easy chair and a cup of tea. You will bear it
better there than here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you say <i>bear</i> it better?"</p>

<p>"Oh! did I say it&mdash;<i>bear</i> it&mdash;Martha? I am sure
I don't know. I think I said hear it, Catherine.
Oh! for Heaven's sake don't look so stern. Perhaps
you will think nothing of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Catherine gave her foot a stamp upon the ground.
She said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me at once what you have got to tell," in a
voice which was almost threatening. They looked
at each other again, and then Miss Matilda
began&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't want to get any one into trouble, I am
sure," she said in a faltering but eager voice. "It
frightened us so&mdash;that was the thing. It frightened
us about you. I said to Martha, 'Dear Catherine
must be ill; nothing less than that would bring him
here at such an hour.' You see the voices roused us
just as we were going to bed. Mrs. John's door was
locked, for I had heard her do it; she always does it
herself, and, judging by her usual hours, she must
have been in bed&mdash;when we heard voices at the
gate: oh, I was not surprised at that. Sometimes
it is old Captain Morgan himself, who I am sure,
with every respect for him, ought not to be out
of doors at such hours; sometimes the young gentleman,
the grandson&mdash;I don't remember his name;
or it used to be Harry Vernon in his time. We all
know that girl; we needn't say anything more on
that subject. I merely remarked, 'There she is at
the gate again.' And Martha said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I said, 'Fiddlesticks, she is at the ball; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
must be one of the maids.' I am so unsuspicious,"
said Miss Martha.</p>

<p>"And then we listened as you may suppose.
There was just a little corner of the window open.
Of course if it had been one of the maids I should
have thought it my duty&mdash;&mdash; Catherine, you are
getting quite tired."</p>

<p>"I freely confess, yes&mdash;of your story. What do I
care for your maids and their lovers? You can
settle these surely without me."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you will only wait a little! Very soon
we could hear that it was, if you please, Miss
Hester's voice, and she was inviting some one in.
Oh, pressing him&mdash;almost forcing him. Shouldn't
you say so Martha? like the woman in the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, just like that kind of woman. Won't you
come in, just for a moment&mdash;just to rest a bit," said
Martha, changing her voice into a sort of squeak of
the most unseductive kind. "And he resisted as
long as he could; but she would take no denial.
You can't expect a young man to say 'No' if a girl
puts herself at his feet like that. So he yielded at
last, poor young fellow. We didn't blame him a bit,
did we, Martha?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not a bit! poor young man, with such a
creature as that laying herself out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And who was this whom you are so sorry for?"
Catherine said.</p>

<p>As if she did not know! She had been rather
glad of all the delays and <i>longueurs</i> of the tale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
marched along through it, glad to make them out of
breath, almost hoping to be at her own door before
the crisis; but in this she did not succeed. She did
not look at them even, but kept her eyes upon the
path with steady indifference.</p>

<p>"Dear Catherine!&mdash;but you won't blame him,
poor young fellow! It was your own Edward, that
dear boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Prepared as she was, the name gave her a shock, as
perhaps Miss Matilda, still holding her elbow, felt;
but if so, it was only for a moment. "Edward!"
she said with a laugh. "You mean Harry, I
suppose? Edward was at home and busy, occupying
himself in a very different sort of way."</p>

<p>At this the sisters interchanged glances again, and
shook their heads in unison. "Ah, Catherine, that
is just how you are deceived. We know Harry
Vernon's voice very well. It was Edward."</p>

<p>Catherine turned upon them with a countenance
perfectly cloudless, a laugh upon her lips. "When
I tell you," she said, "that he was in my own
house! he could not, I think, be in two places at
once&mdash;my house, his house&mdash;it is all the same. He
was at home&mdash;" she added after a moment, in a
deeper tone, "and with me."</p>

<p>"Oh! with you!" The sisters broke off with
sudden fright, not venturing to persevere. So
sudden a check quenched Miss Matilda's lively
genius altogether. It was her sister, the practical
member, who added with a spasmodic gasp, "Oh,
of course, Catherine, if he was with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course he was with me; he is only too
attentive. I could wish he took a little more
amusement. So your fine story is at an end, you
see. If it had been any one else I might have
thought it my duty to inquire into it; but as I can
prove it not to be Edward&mdash;not that I see much
harm in it if it had been Edward," she added,
turning upon the accusers again. "I am not fond
of Hester Vernon, but she is his cousin all the
same."</p>

<p>"Oh, no harm! oh, I never thought so," cried the
gossips, alarmed and faltering. "It was only just&mdash;it
was merely&mdash;it frightened us, thinking that dear
Catherine must be ill, or something happened&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you think then that your dear Catherine, if
she were ill, would send for Hester Vernon?&mdash;as her
prime favourite, I suppose, and the one that loved
her best among all those who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Catherine paused; the native magnanimity in her,
beneath all the pettiness which her laughing cynicism
had taught her, would not insult even these heartless
women by a reminder in so many words of their dependence.
It cost her all her strength to stand up
erect before them, and put off their assault. They
had got at her heart, but they should never know
it. She stood ample and serene between the two
slim shabby figures and smiled defiance. Never
were talebearers more completely discomfited. They
turned upon each other with mutual reproaches
in the confusion of the moment. "You need not
have made such a fuss, Matilda." "I told you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Martha, you oughtn't to be so confident about a
voice."</p>

<p>"Come," said Catherine, "we had better say
nothing more about it; evidently there has been
a mistake. Hester, who ought to be more careful
if she is to live at the Vernonry, must have another
admirer with whose voice you are not acquainted.
But it is unwise to form conclusions on no better
ground than the sound of a voice, and perhaps not
very charitable or kind of you, so much older than
she is, to tell anything that is uncomfortable about
that girl, who is no favourite of mine already, to
me. Don't you think you would do better if you
warned her, or her mother?" Catherine's countenance
was so calm, her eyes so commanding, that
the Miss Vernon-Ridgways, altogether defeated in
their malicious intention, which was chiefly to wound
herself, felt their knees tremble under them, and
were genuinely awe-stricken for perhaps the first
time in their lives.</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that&mdash;it was not Hester we were
thinking of&mdash;it was you," they faltered between
them, "that you might not allow&mdash;or be exposed&mdash;"
Their words got incoherent and ran away to nothing,
into breaks and frightened lapses. And when
Catherine, opening her eyes still wider, said, "For
me! to warn me!" and laughed them to scorn,
Matilda, who being the most forward was at the
same time the most sensitive, was so overcome by
anger and alarm and mortification that she began
to cry for sheer despite, and felt in her inmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
heart that she hated the woman who could humiliate
her so.</p>

<p>"You were kindly afraid that I should be tired a
few minutes ago: and standing does tire me, though
I like a walk," Catherine said. "I will say good-bye
now. Perhaps you meant it kindly; and if so,
I'll thank you too&mdash;all the more as it's a mistake&mdash;for
that is the best of it," she said with a laugh,
waving her hand: and leaving them, walked on
homewards with an alert and energetic step. But
it would have been balm to their feelings if they
had been able to see how very little like laughter
was her face when she had once turned her back
upon them. There was nobody to observe her along
that quiet road. The nursemaids with their children
had all turned townwards some time ago. There
was not a soul between her and the gate of the
Grange. Catherine's face lengthened and darkened
as if by a sudden effect of years; the sanguine life
and confidence and force went out of it. She looked
an old woman in that moment, as indeed she had a
right to do, but did not, nature interposing for her
aid. She said to herself that she would not think,
would not ask herself what it meant until she should
get home, and could feel the shelter of her own
walls about her. She wanted shelter and privacy
before she faced the fact which had been dimly
shadowing before her, but never in this form. She
was a very resolute woman, and had not come so far
in life without having to confront and overcome
many things that looked terrible enough at the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
glance. But never since those early days which
were so far off that they were half forgotten had
she been called upon to face those troubles which
sap the strength out of heart and will, the disappointments
and bitterness brought upon us by
those we love. She had few of these sufferings for
what seems the saddest reason, that she had nobody
to love. But it was not so sad as it appears. She
had a number of people whom she loved well
enough to be delighted by their prosperities, and
overcast by their troubles. She had all the advantages
of affection without being so closely knit to
any as to have its drawbacks too. But this easy
position changed when she became, so to speak, the
mother of Edward Vernon. It was not the doing of
providence, it was her own doing. She had taken it
upon herself, and for years past she had said to
herself that the boy had made her know, as she had
never known before, what happiness was. But now
here was, swinging round slowly, revealing itself to
her in glimpses, the reverse of the medal, the other
side of the picture. Was he deceiving her? She
had taken up his defence boldly, not caring what she
said: but she had believed what she heard all the
same, and had known it to be true. Was this why
he had not cared to see her, to bid her good-night,
before he came out to have that meeting with Hester&mdash;like
a shopgirl and shopboy, she said to herself,
her lip quivering with passion, vexation, derision, all
bound together by the pain that produced them&mdash;at
the gate? The commonplace character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
meeting, the look of petty intrigue in it, humbled
her pride in her boy. If they had met at Ellen's
dance, or in any legitimate way, she thought it
would not have mortified her so much&mdash;but like
a lady's maid and a footman, like Jane the scullery-girl
and her young man! She laughed to herself
at the thought, but the laugh was more painful
than tears.</p>

<p>By and by, however, Catherine came to take a
little comfort out of the fact that Edward had not
come to bid her good-night. Not considering for a
moment that any incident of all this might be
accidental, though everything was so, she concluded
that his heart had failed him, that he had felt
himself incapable of the treachery of kissing her
cheek in the usual tender way when about to do
a thing which he knew would be so displeasing to
her. When this occurred to Catherine the whole
aspect of the matter changed: her features relaxed,
her colour came back. This, no doubt, was how it
had been. The girl had met him at Ellen's folly&mdash;how
truly a folly had never been proved till now:
and she was pretty and clever. Catherine was too
proud to deny her her natural advantages; and men
were fools, as was well known&mdash;the best of them,
the wisest of them!&mdash;where women were concerned.
She had led him into some engagement, some light
wager perhaps, some defiance of what he would
venture to do. And Edward had been silly enough
to be led away. She did not want him to be too
wise. If he was silly, it was no more than everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
else had been before him. But he, dear boy,
true boy, having involved himself in a piece of
folly, had shown that high respect to her, that he
would rather let her suppose he had forgotten and
neglected her, than come to her with the usual
greeting when he knew he was doing something
which would seem treachery to Catherine. Thus
she, who for the first moment had known no wish
but that of pushing homeward and hiding her
sudden downfall within her own house where
nobody could intrude upon her, had so triumphantly
explained all that trouble away before she got home,
that she entered the Grange radiant, with no sense
of having a downfall to hide. The casuistry of love
is more skilful than any device of philosophy. She
explained everything to herself. She wondered that
she had not read it in his face all the evening.
She felt that it had been there, if she had only
had eyes to see. A foolish talk carried a trifle too
far&mdash;a bold girl, not bad, no, not bad&mdash;that was not
necessary, and Catherine would be just&mdash;pleased to
get a little triumph when she could over the other
side: and a foolish promise, not intended, had drawn
him, perhaps against his will. By this subtle
demonstration&mdash;which no faculty less keen than that
of love could have made&mdash;Catherine proved, to her
full satisfaction, the fundamental truth in him which
no little trumpery deceit (of a kind so innocent as
this!) could undermine. All this fine fabric was
raised on the most insignificant foundation of fact.
But what did that matter? it was enough. And if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Catherine had been told that Edward's forgetfulness
of the good-night had been accidental, and that his
meeting with Hester was accidental, and that no
incident of the night had been planned beforehand,
she would have simply and flatly denied the possibility.
She knew better; and she preferred the
matter as it stood.</p>

<p>The dinner-party was an insignificant affair to
her after this. She did full justice to it, and to
Roland Ashton, the chief guest, the man whom she
delighted to honour, and for whose pleasure and
profit the best people in Redborough were called
together. He was already known to many of them,
and it was Catherine's pleasure to make her relationship
and interest in the young visitor clear.
But her mind was eager to get through the
commonplace courtesies of the evening&mdash;to come
to the moment when Edward and she should meet
alone. She could not pass her discovery over
without note. She would tell him what she had
heard, and what she had divined. She would give
him the tender warning which such an affection
as hers had a right to offer. If it was more than
a passing flirtation (which she did not believe), to
beg him to reconsider it; if his heart should be
touched (which Heaven forbid! but the thought
made her smile, it was so profoundly unlikely), to
intreat him to reflect, and see how little satisfaction
could come to him from such intercourse. She went
over and over again the interview that was to come&mdash;so
often, indeed, that she exhausted it, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the moment did come, did not remember half of
what she intended to say. It came, indeed, in a
way entirely contrary to that she had imagined.
After the party had dispersed, Edward took Roland
into his room to smoke with him&mdash;which she ought
to have recollected he was in the habit of doing&mdash;and
then, what was more disappointing still, went
out with him to accompany him part of the way.
She was going down stairs to Edward's room, that
she might get these explanations off her mind
without a moment's delay, and was taken entirely
by surprise when she heard the door close, and two
voices continuing outside.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Edward gone out?" she asked, with
a trembling she could scarcely control, of the butler,
when he came up to put out the lights.</p>

<p>"I was to say, ma'am, as he'd be back in half an
hour," said the man.</p>

<p>Catherine sent her maid to bed, and kept her
particular lamp burning on her little table, waiting
there in the dimness of the large deserted room,
hearing every crackle and rustle of the night. It
seemed to her far more than half an hour before
she heard Edward's key in the door; but she was
resolved not to be balked now. She had no idea,
poor lady, that he thought her suspicious, inquisitive,
and watchful, making domiciliary visits in order to
find him out in something, which was very far from
Catherine's disposition. She went down accordingly
to lose no time, and met him in the hall. He was
astonished to see her, as was natural enough; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
she had an uneasy tremor upon her, which was
natural too, but which looked like cold. He was
full of apologies for having kept her up.</p>

<p>"If I had known you would have waited for me,
Aunt Catherine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did not say good-night to me last night,
Edward. I did not like that to happen two nights
running. I will go into your room, not to hurry
you up stairs."</p>

<p>"I can't think how that happened," he said,
following her into the cosy room, with its red
curtains and cheerful fire, and all the conveniences
and prettiness she had accumulated for him there.
"I had been thinking hard, and my mind was full of
balance-sheets and figures. I entirely forgot I had
not seen you."</p>

<p>She turned round upon him, taking his arm
between her hands, and looking with a tender
smile into his face.</p>

<p>"No, my dear boy, I know better than that.
You had a reason&mdash;which shows me how well I
have divined you, and how true you are, Edward.
I have been told where&mdash;you went to last night."</p>

<p>This startled him greatly for the moment. He
looked at her with an alarmed expression: but
seeing no anger in her face, said quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"That was all quite accidental, Aunt Catherine.
You don't think I went there on purpose, do you?"
without shrinking at all from her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, Edward, I thought you did. Perhaps I
was wrong. I thought there might have been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
silly bargain&mdash;some promise made without thought:
and that you felt a little treacherous&mdash;that is a harsh
word&mdash;deceitful&mdash;that is worse&mdash;to me, and would
not come back and kiss me when you might be
supposed to be going against me. I forgave you
entirely, Edward, for that good thought."</p>

<p>He was a little touched in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"You are very good, Aunt Catherine&mdash;far better
to me than I deserve; but, as a matter of fact, it
was all purely accidental. I had been very busy,
and felt feverish and sleepless. I went out to have
a turn in the moonlight: chance took me that way.
There was light in Mrs. John's window. They heard
my steps, and looked out in great surprise, and asked
me to come in. I could scarcely satisfy her," he said,
with an embarrassed little laugh, "that you were not
ill, and had not sent for her to nurse you. It was as
good as a play," he went on, still laughing, followed
in every word by her anxious eyes, "to see poor Mrs.
John's struggle between politeness and sleep. She
was very sleepy, poor little woman! but dreadfully
polite. You may suppose I was surprised enough
to find myself there."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, still holding him, still reading his
face with her anxious eyes, but feeling the ground
cut from under her feet. She was a little breathless
with anxiety and excitement. "I wonder&mdash;that you
did not tell me of it&mdash;this morning."</p>

<p>"Dear Aunt Catherine," he said, "pardon me, but
you have a little prejudice, you know, against these
people. And it was so entirely accidental. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
might have thought, had I told you, that it had
been done on purpose."</p>

<p>"Did I ever doubt what you said to me, Edward?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, taking her hands in his tenderly, as
she thought; and indeed the action was not without
real tenderness, for his heart was touched. "No,"
he said, smiling, "but yet you would have had a little
doubt&mdash;a little wonder whether it was really so."</p>

<p>"And it <i>was</i> really so?" she said, looking into his
face, "really&mdash;really&mdash;no little shadow of a wish for&mdash;a
little provocation, a little talk, a little fun if you
like, Edward? Oh, no, I have no prejudice. I
should know it was quite natural. And you mean
that there was nothing at all, nothing of this&mdash;a
mere accident, nothing more?"</p>

<p>He kissed her cheek, and he laughed at her in
a filial way.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you, Aunt Catherine? You believe
me&mdash;oh, yes; but then you ask me if really&mdash;really
I am saying what is true? Really&mdash;really as often
as you like; it was accident, and nothing more."</p>

<p>This was how all the eloquent things which
Catherine had prepared to say were never said.
She went up to bed pleased and happy, yet not so
pleased as if he had confessed her version of the story
to be the true one. She did not doubt his word&mdash;oh
no, no&mdash;but yet&mdash;the other version looked more
true to nature. She could have understood it
better that way.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>IN THE LABYRINTH.</h3>


<p>After these events there seemed a lull, in which
nothing more seemed to happen. Though time is so
short, and our modern pace of living, we flatter ourselves,
so much more rapid than of old, how few after
all are the periods in which things happen, and with
what long stretches of vacant days between! Hester
could hardly explain to herself how it was that
Edward Vernon's sudden evening visit, so unexpected,
so unprecedented, had made an entire revolution
in her life. There had been no mutual
confessions of love, no proposal, no acceptance such
as are supposed to be necessary. There was nothing
to confide to her mother, had it been possible to take
any one into that strait union of two suddenly
become one. The effect bewildered her entirely, and
she could not tell how it had been produced; but yet
it was so. They had been on the eve of this, she
felt, for years, and the first time that they met, in a
moment of complete freedom, their souls flowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
together, flowed into one. Perhaps he had not
meant it when he came. The dim parlour and the
sleepy mother, trying hard to be polite, quite unconscious
how unnecessary her presence was; the young
man, with his eager eyes, scarcely keeping himself in&mdash;came
before her like a curious picture a hundred
times in a day: and then the sudden sweep of the
torrent after it, the almost involuntary, impetuous,
unalterable junction of these two hearts and lives.
But the shock even of happiness when it comes so
suddenly is great; and Hester was not sure even
that she was happy. He seemed to have led her to
the edge of some labyrinth, without freedom to leave
it, or to advance into its mysteries. There was a
clue, indeed, but it was lying in loose coils at her
feet, and who could tell if it ever could be sufficiently
straightened, sufficiently tightened, to give any real
guidance? There was no habit of meeting in their
lives, no way of seeing each other even, without
attracting suspicion. He sent her a letter next
morning, full of love, and of ecstatic realisation that
she was his, and that in all his difficulties he was sure
of her sympathy, but it was understood that he was
not to make such a breach of all his habits as to come
to see her; and Hester was too proud to break
through hers, as she had done that one morning in
order to see him. So that everything remained a
secret between them, and save for the sudden understanding
into which they had leaped, the sort of
betrothal which both took for granted, there was no
difference in their outward lives; which was a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of things infinitely painful to the girl who lived her
usual daily life with her mother and her friends in a
state of guilty abstraction, thinking of <i>him</i> all the
time, and feeling herself a domestic traitor. She felt
that it was but the shell of her that remained, following
mechanically the usual occupations, talking
from the lips outward, absorbed in a long perpetual
reverie of new consciousness, new hopes and fears.
That secret world had need to have been bright to
make up to her for the sense of guilt and treachery
with which she entered into it: and it was not
bright. The air was dark and tremulous as in that
sad valley, sad yet sweet, which, in Dante, lies outside
of hell. She never could tell at what moment
some dark unknown shape of calamity might appear
through its twilight coming towards them; for
Edward had been driven to her by anxiety and
trouble, and the sense of a burden which he could
not bear alone. What was it? He did not tell her
in his letter. The other little notes he wrote were
but appeals to her sympathy&mdash;petitions to her to
love him, to think of him. Ah! Hester thought to
herself, no fear of that&mdash;but how? What was she
to think? in what way was her imagination to follow
him, groping dimly amid scenes she did not understand?
His secret was as a germ of fire in her
heart&mdash;which by times blazed up into hot flames,
devouring her with all the anguish of that thirst to
know which is one of the tortures of uneasy love.
What was it that troubled him so, that alarmed him
so, that might ruin and overwhelm him&mdash;that might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
make him fly, which was the most mysterious hint
of all? But to all these questions she got no satisfaction.
For the first few days she had a little
furtive outlet to her anxiety in questioning Roland,
which she did with a vague sense of treachery to
Edward, as if she were endeavouring to surprise his
secrets by a back way, but very little perception of
the false impression which her interest in his communications
was making upon Roland, who himself
became day by day more ready to believe that
marriage might become a possible venture, and that
the decision of it rested chiefly with himself. He
knew no other reason why she should question him
than interest in himself, and it was with a grateful
zeal that he attempted to gratify a curiosity which
was so legitimate, yet so unusual. He explained his
trade with that pleasure which the wisest of men feel
in talking about themselves, and never divined that
her rapid mind passed everything through one
narrow test, <i>i.e.</i> whether it was possible that it could
concern Edward. She did not even remark the
<i>attendrissement</i> with which he received her questions,
with eyes that said volumes. These eyes overflowed
with pleasure and sentiment as he made his little
disquisitions.</p>

<p>"After this," he said, with a laugh, "you will be
armed <i>cap-&agrave;-pied</i> against any doubtful agency, and
able when you like to speculate for yourself."</p>

<p>"And why should not I speculate," said Hester,
"if I had any money? It is like fighting, I suppose.
It feels like living, they say. But after all it is no
true life&mdash;only figures, as you tell me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Figures," said Roland, "mean so much; in this
elemental way they mean money. And money
means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Figures over again," Hester said, with a certain
weary disdain. It was not possible that this alone
could be the tragic danger, the burden of the soul
that Edward meant. But Roland was thinking his
own thoughts, and interpreted her comments in a
way of his own.</p>

<p>"It means most things in this world," he said;
"unfortunately, however high-minded we are, we
can do nothing without it. It means of course
show and luxury, and gaiety, and all the things you
despise; but at the same time&mdash;&mdash; It means," he
said, after a little pause, "the house which two
people could make into paradise. It means ease
of mind, so that a man can rise every day without
anxiety, knowing that he has enough for every
claim upon him. Ah! how can I say all that it
means&mdash;you would laugh, or be frightened. It
means the right to love, and the right to say it."
Roland was making use of all his well-worn artillery,
but of something more besides which he had not
quite understood the existence of&mdash;something which
lent a very eloquent tremor to his voice and doubled
the seduction of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! I was not thinking of anything half so
sentimental," said Hester. She never looked at him,
to be affected by his glances, or paid any attention
to his voice. And yet there had been a moment
when Roland's departure made the world itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
shrink and look narrow: but she remembered
nothing about that now. "To tell the truth, all
I was thinking of was buying and selling," she said;
"for business means that, doesn't it? Of course I
suppose, as we must have money to live, you may
say that money is the first thing in life, more
necessary than bread; but I did not mean that."</p>

<p>Conversations which ended in this way were,
however, very little serviceable to Hester, for how
could she tell which of these mysteries of the craft
had entangled Edward, or if any of them could
justify the seriousness of his excitement, the tragic
sense of a possible catastrophe, the wild expedient
of flight, which had been in his words! All this
talk about the vicissitudes of money was too petty
to satisfy her mind as a reason. And still less was
that talk calculated to promote Roland's purpose,
who did not care very much what he was saying
so long as he could recommend himself to her
favourable opinion. What he wanted was to show
her that the future had large possibilities of advancement.
He wanted, without committing himself or
doing anything that could be afterwards commented
upon as "behaving badly," to leave upon Hester's
mind a delicate intimation that he meant to come
back, to speak more plainly, to say things more
worthy of her attention; and that she might be
able to make up her mind in the meantime and
not be taken by surprise. Roland was not so
romantic as to be unaware that the advantages
lay on his own side; he had solid gifts to give,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and a position to offer, which could not be carelessly
considered by any person of sense. And he was
well aware that there was no crowd of candidates
contending for Hester's hand. She had to him the
air of a girl neglected, altogether out of the way of
forming any satisfactory engagements, almost painfully
divested of that "chance" which Emma looked
at with such sensible if matter-of-fact eyes. Roland,
to do him justice, was all the more willing to show
her a romantic devotion on this account, but it kept
him free from anxiety about his own hopes. There
had been Harry indeed&mdash;but she would not have
Harry. And Edward he was aware had paid her
furtive "attentions" at Ellen Merridew's parties;
but what could Edward do? He could not pay
serious addresses to any one, in his circumstances,
far less to Hester: and he was not the fellow to
marry a girl without money and under the cold
shade of Catherine's disfavour. This last was one
of the things that made Roland himself hesitate&mdash;but
he thought it might be got over. And there
could be no doubt that his mind had made great
strides towards making itself up during this
Christmas visit. But it was a short visit on the
whole, for he had not much time to spare for
pleasure, and his business had been summarily
ended. Emma thought it was owing to Hester's
interference that she was left behind, Reginald
Merridew having not yet "spoken;" but there
was in reality a certain sympathy in Roland's mind
with his sister's honest desire to be settled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
there would be much convenience in it could it be
accomplished, he felt. He went away accordingly,
slightly depressed by Hester's indifferent farewell,
and remembering the look of over-clearness in her
eyes when he had gone away the first time with a
sort of fond regret. He was sure that day that she
had shed a few tears over his departure, of which
there was no appearance now. But soon he recovered
his spirits, asking himself to look the
situation in the face. Who else was there? What
rival could he have? There was nobody. She
was stranded in that old house as if it had been a
desolate island. And she could not be content to
vegetate there for ever, a girl of her spirit. There
was a practical element in Roland's character,
notwithstanding his romantic eyes.</p>

<p>And Hester was so ungrateful that his departure
was almost a relief to her. She forgot altogether
that she had cried the first time when he went
away, and she was glad to be set free from the
hope, which at the same time was a fear, of finding
out something about Edward's troubles from his
chance revelations. Her mind turned now with
unbroken eagerness to the sole means of intercourse
which she had with her lover, which could be calculated
upon with any freedom, which were Ellen's
parties&mdash;the <i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i>! It seemed incredible
that her entire existence should be concentrated in
a weekly assembly so frivolous, so thoughtless, and
nonsensical, and that all those grave and troublous
thoughts should seek interpretation in a dance. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
so it was. The first of them brought her only
disappointment, and that of a kind that she felt
almost maddening&mdash;for Edward did not appear.
He gave her no warning, which was cruel, and
when she found, after hours of waiting, that he
was not expected, the shock of resentment and
shame and dismay almost stunned her: but pride
carried the day. She threw herself into the current
with a sort of desperation, and held her place with
the gayest: then entered, sombre and silent, upon
another week of suspense. The second occasion
was not so bad. He was there, and appropriated
her as usual, and breathed hints into her ear which
kept her in a whirl of excitement.</p>

<p>"How can I explain to you," he said, "here?
And even if I could explain to you, I don't want
to do it, for it is all miserable trade, which you
would not understand&mdash;which I don't wish you
to understand."</p>

<p>"But I want to understand it, Edward. You
don't think how cruel it is to me to tell me just
so much, then leave me outside."</p>

<p>"Should I <i>not</i> have told you so much?" he said,
looking at her. "You are right. I believe you are
right, Hester; but my heart was running over, and
to no one else could I say a word. I could not put
a little bit of my burden upon any one but you.
I know it was selfish, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward; it is not that. I will bear your
burden; I am glad to help you; I would bear it all
for you if I could," she cried with her bright eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
widening, her cheeks glowing with enthusiasm.
"Don't you <i>know</i> that I would bear it all if I
could? It is not that. But tell me, only tell me
a little more."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Hester," he said, "that is not what a man wants
in a woman; not to go and explain it all to her with
pen and ink, and tables and figures, to make her understand
as he would have to do with a man. What
he wants, dear, is very different&mdash;just to lean upon
you&mdash;to know that you sympathise, and think of
me, and feel for me, and believe in me, and that
you will share whatever comes."</p>

<p>Hester said nothing, but her countenance grew
very grave.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that a woman could do all that&mdash;and
yet that it would be easier for her if she
understood what it was, and why it was?" she said,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"Dear," said Edward, gazing at her with glowing
eyes. He was in a hopeful mood, and he allowed
himself to indulge the love and pleasure he felt in
her, having bound her to him with a chain more
fast than iron. "Darling! was it ever known that
a woman, a girl like you (if there ever was a girl
like my Hester), thought of what would be easiest?
And you who would bear it all, you said."</p>

<p>"So I should&mdash;gladly; but then I should
understand."</p>

<p>"My only love! understanding is nothing, it matters
nothing; another fellow, any man, a clerk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
office, would understand. I want your sympathy. I
want&mdash;you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward!" she cried, "you have me and my
sympathy&mdash;even if you were wrong you should have my
sympathy. But is it just, is it good, do you think,
that you should ask all that and tell me nothing? I
am a woman, but I am not a fool. I can understand
most things. Try me&mdash;tell me&mdash;I will set my mind
to it. Sympathy that is ignorant cannot be so good
as sympathy that knows."</p>

<p>He made a little pause, and then he said, looking
at her, she felt, severely, with a scoff in his voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"And where is this explanation to take place?
Will you appoint to meet me somewhere with my
balance-sheet and my vouchers? Perhaps you will
come to my room at the bank? or appoint an accountant
whom you can trust?"</p>

<p>"Edward!" she drew her hand out of his arm and
then put it back again after a moment's hesitation,
"do you want me to look a wretch even to myself?
Why should you say all this? and why&mdash;why be so
unjust to me? You forget that when one knows
nothing one thinks all sorts of things, and invents a
hundred terrors. Tell me how it is in the general
not details. You do not want silly sympathy."</p>

<p>"I want all your sympathy, silly or not. I want
you. Hester, if we are to escape notice we must
dance like the rest; we cannot stand and talk all
night. And I am just in the mood for it!" he cried.</p>

<p>Many people no doubt have waltzed with very
little inclination for it, people who were both sad and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
sorry, disappointed, heartbroken; but few more reluctant
than Hester, who felt her position intolerable,
and by whom the complacent injustice of it, the calm
assertion that such blind adherence was all that was
to be looked for from a woman, was more irritating
and offensive than can be described. Was it possible
that he thought so? that this was what she would
have to encounter in the life she should spend with
him? Her advice, her intelligent help, her understanding,
all ignored, and nothing wanted but a kind
of doggish fidelity, an unreasoning belief? Hester felt
it cruel to be made to dance even, to be spun through
the crowd as if in the merest caprice of gaiety while
at such a crisis of her fate.</p>

<p>But neither this nor their subsequent conversations
made any difference; the evening passed for her as
in a dream. Edward, who was not much of a dancer,
and seldom cared to perform these rites with any
partner but herself, danced repeatedly with others
that night, while Hester stood by looking on with
gathering bewilderment. She had a headache, she
said. It was her mother's way of getting free of
every embarrassment, and Hester was acquainted
with the expedient, though she had not hitherto
been tempted to use it. She sat by Mrs. Merridew,
the mother of the house, who was a kind
woman, and disposed to be good to her. "Just say
the word, my dear, and as soon as our carriage comes
I will take you home," this lady said; "for to sit
with a racking headache and watch other young folks
dancing is more than flesh and blood can bear." But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
alas! Mrs. Merridew's carriage was not ordered till
two o'clock, and Hester had to bear her burden. And
of course it was not thus that the evening ended. He
came to seek her at Mrs. Merridew's side, and heard
the account of her headache with a sympathetic
countenance.</p>

<p>"This was our dance," he said; "but come into the
hall instead, where it is cool, and let me get you some
tea." He placed her there in the shelter of the evergreens,
when all the hubbub of the next dance was in full
progress. They were quiet, almost alone, and Edward
was in a fever of high spirits and excitement. He
had said little about love in that strange moment
when he had taken possession of her. Now he made
up for all deficiencies. She endeavoured at first to
bring him back to what she called the more important
subject. "Can any subject be more important?"
he said with tender reproach. And she was silenced,
for what could she say? And the moments flew too
fast and were too brief to be lost in any struggle.
They parted with a few mysterious words whispered
into her ear, which did much however to bring back
the painful tension which had relaxed a little in his
presence. "If I send to you, you will see me,
Hester?" he whispered. "You won't think of proprieties?
I might have to put your love to the test&mdash;to
ask you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" she cried with almost a spasm of alarm.
He gave her hand a warning clasp as he put her into
the fly, and then stooping to arrange the shawls
around her, kissed it secretly. And that was all. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
drove home in the silence and dark, feeling every
word thrill her through, going over it again and again.
What was this test of love that might be required of
her? What did he expect her to do for him, in
ignorance, in blind trust? Hester had too high a
spirit to accept this <i>r&ocirc;le</i> with ease. She was bewildered&mdash;dazzled
by the lavish outpouring of his love; but
all that did not blind her to the strange injustice of
this treatment, the cruelty of her helpless position.
For what could she do? She could not desert him in
his hour of need; if he made this call upon her which
he spoke of so mysteriously, it would no doubt be in
his utmost need, when to desert him would be like
a traitor. And Hester knew that she could confront
any danger with him or for him&mdash;but what was it?
A dilemma so terrible had never presented itself to
her imagination. There was a cruelty in it, a depreciation
of all the nobler parts of her, as if only in ignorance
could she be trusted. Her mother's questions
about the ball, and whether she had danced much,
and who her partners had been, were insupportable,
as insupportable as the maunderings of Emma. In
short, if there was anything that could have made
this mystery and darkness in which her way seemed
lost, more hard to bear, it was the background of
amusement and supposed light-heartedness against
which it was set. "My head ached," she said. "I
scarcely danced at all," by way of freeing herself;
but this opened only another kind of torture, for
poor Mrs. John, well used to the feminine indulgence
of headaches, had a whole surgery of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
remedies, and bathed her child's forehead, and drew
back her hair, and would have administered sal-volatile,
tea, eau-de-cologne&mdash;there was no telling
how many cures&mdash;if she had been allowed.</p>

<p>"Let me fan you then, my love: sometimes that
does me a great deal of good. Just let me pour a
little eau-de-cologne first; you don't know how
cooling it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! let me be still; let me be in the
dark; go to bed, and don't mind me," cried Hester.</p>

<p>"My love! how could I do that and leave my
child to suffer," said Mrs. John, heroically&mdash;and it
was heroic, for the night was cold, the fire burning
low, the hour three o'clock. Hester, with her brain
throbbing, all inaccessible to eau-de-cologne, did not
know how to free her mother from this too generous
unnecessary martyrdom. She began to talk to
break the spell.</p>

<p>"Emma is very happy," she said, "she danced with
Edward Vernon. She thinks perhaps it may make
the other speak, or that even Edward himself&mdash;"
Hester broke off with a quiver in her lip. "I am
becoming malicious like the rest," she said.</p>

<p>"That is not malicious, dear," said Mrs. John.
"Emma is very amusing, being so frank, but she is
right enough when you come to think of it; for what
can she do if she does not marry? And I am sure
Edward Vernon, though Catherine makes such a fuss
about him, is nothing so very great. I wonder what
he meant coming here that one night, and so late."</p>

<p>"It was by accident," Hester said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a very odd accident," cried her mother,
"no one else ever did so."</p>

<p>"He had been sitting late over his work, and his
head was very full of&mdash;business."</p>

<p>Mrs. John looked in all the confidence of superior
wisdom into her daughter's face. A smile dawned
upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think he was coming to confide his
troubles about his business, Hester, to you and
me."</p>

<p>"And why not?" said Hester, raising herself from
her bed.</p>

<p>Mrs. John dropped her fan in her surprise, and sat
down abruptly upon the little chair by Hester's
bedside, to her daughter's great relief.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said. "I think, though you are
my own, that you are the strangest girl I ever knew.
Do you think a man <i>ever</i> talks to women about these
things? Oh, perhaps to a woman like Catherine
that is the same as a man. But to anybody he
cares for&mdash;never, oh, never, dear! I suppose he has
a respect for you and me; think of any man venturing
to bring business into my drawing-room, though
it is only a poor little parlour now, not a drawing-room
at all. Oh, no, that could never&mdash;never be! In
all my life I never descended so low as that," Mrs.
John said, with dignity. "I used to be brought into
contact with a great many business people when your
poor dear papa was living; but they never talked
'shop,' as they call it, before me."</p>

<p>"But my father himself?" said Hester, her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
blazing with the keenest interest; "you knew all his
affairs?"</p>

<p>Mrs. John held her delicate little hands clasped for
a moment, and then flung them apart, as if throwing
the suspicion away.</p>

<p>"Never!" she cried; "he respected me too much.
Your poor papa was incautious about money, Hester,
and that has done a great deal of harm to both
of us, for we are poor, and we ought to have
been rich; but he always had too much respect for
me to mix me up with business. You are very inexperienced,
my dear, or you would know that such a
thing could not be."</p>

<p>Hester followed her mother with her large eyes,
with a wondering wide gaze, which answered well
enough for that of believing surprise, almost awe,
which Mrs. John was very willing to recognise as a
suitable expression. And there was indeed a sort of
awe in the girl's perception of her mother's perfectly
innocent, perfectly assured theory of what was right
in women. What wonder that a man should think
so, when women themselves thought so? This
strange discovery composed and stilled her when at
last she was left in the dark and in peace.</p>

<p>Hester kept gazing through that wintry blackness,
with eyes still wide open, and her clear brows
puckered with wonder and alarm. Was it natural,
then, a thing she could accept as just, that it was
enough for her to sympathise, to share the consequences,
to stand by the chief actor whatever happened,
but never to share in the initiative or have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
any moral concern in the motive or the means of
what was done? A sense of helplessness began to
take the place of indignation in her mind. Was
that what they called the natural lot of women? to
suffer, perhaps to share the blame, but have no
share in the plan, to sympathise, but not to know;
to move on blindly according to some rule of loyalty
and obedience, which to any other creature in the
world would be folly and guilt? But her mother
knew nothing of such hard words. To her this was
not only the right state of affairs, but to suggest any
better rule was to fail in respect to the lady whose
right it was to be left ignorant. Hester tried to
smile when she recalled this, but could not, her heart
being too sore, her whole being shaken. <i>He</i> thought
so too perhaps, everybody thought so, and she alone,
an involuntary rebel, would be compelled to accept
the yoke which, to other women, was a simple
matter, and their natural law. Why, then, was she
made unlike others, or why was it so?</p>

<p>Edward had been in great spirits that night. The
next time they met was in the afternoon late, when
Hester was returning from a visit to Mrs. Morgan.
It was nearly dark, and it startled her to see him
standing waiting for her under one of the trees past
the gate of the Heronry. She went slowly, somewhat
reluctantly, to join him on the sign just discernible
in the dark which he made her. He caught
her hand quickly, as she came up, and drew it
within his arm.</p>

<p>"You have been so long with that old woman, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
I have wanted you so," he cried, leading her away
along the deserted country road, which struck off
at right angles with the Common. "Couldn't you
divine that I wanted you? Didn't you know by
instinct I was longing for consolation?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward! what is wrong? What has made
so great a change in you?" she cried.</p>

<p>He drew her arm closer and closer through his,
and leaned upon her as if his appeal for support was
physical too.</p>

<p>"I told you it was too long to explain," he said;
"it is all the worry of business. Sometimes things
seem going well, and then I am top-gallant high, and
vex you with my levity, as the other night&mdash;you know
you were vexed the other night: and then things
turn badly, and I am low, low down in the depths,
and want my love to comfort me. Oh, if you only
belonged to me, Hester, and we had a home somewhere
where I could go in to you and say 'Console
me!'"</p>

<p>"But Edward, your business never used to be a
fever and an excitement like this."</p>

<p>"How do you know? I did not dare to come to
you; and you were a child then. Ah, but you are
quite right, Hester; it was different. But a man
cannot vegetate for ever. I endured it as long as I
could. Now it is all on a turn of the cards, and I
may be able to face the world to-morrow, and have
my own way."</p>

<p>"On a turn of the cards! Edward, you cannot
mean it is play? You are not a&mdash;gambler?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Hester gave a little convulsive cry, clutching him by
the arm with both her hands.</p>

<p>He laughed. "Not with cards, certainly," he said.
"I am a respectable banker, my darling, and very
knowing in my investments, with perhaps a taste for
speculation&mdash;but that nobody has brought home to
me yet. It is a very legitimate way of making a
fortune, Hester. It is only when you lose that it
becomes a thing to blame."</p>

<p>"Do you mean speculation, Edward?"</p>

<p>"Something of that sort; a capital horse when it
carries you over the ford&mdash;and everything that is
bad when you lose."</p>

<p>"But do you mean&mdash;tell me&mdash;that it is simple
speculation&mdash;that this is all that makes you anxious?"
Hester had never heard that speculation was immoral,
and her mind was relieved in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Only&mdash;simple speculation! Good Lord! what
would she have?" he cried, in a sort of unconscious
aside, with a strange laugh; then added, with mock
gravity, "that's all, my darling; not much, is it?
You don't think it is worth making such a fuss
about?"</p>

<p>"I did not say that," said Hester, gravely, "for I
don't understand it, nor what may be involved; but
it cannot touch the heart. I was afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of something much worse," he said, with the
same strange laugh. "What were you afraid of?&mdash;tell
me. You did not think I was robbing the
bank, or killing Catherine?"</p>

<p>"Edward!"&mdash;she did not like these pleasantries&mdash;"why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
do you talk so wildly? Come in with me,
and my mother will give you some tea."</p>

<p>"I want you, and not any tea. I should like to
take you up in my arms, and carry you away&mdash;away&mdash;where
nobody could know anything about us
more. I should like to disappear with you, Hester,
and let people suppose we were dead or lost, or
whatever they pleased."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Hester, "why you should have
lived so long close to me, and never found out that
you wanted me so much till now. Oh, don't laugh so!
You have always been very cool, and quite master
of yourself, till now."</p>

<p>"It was time enough, it appears, when you make
so little response," he said; "but all that is very
simple if you but knew. I had to keep well with
so many. Now that it is all on a turn of the dice,
and a moment may decide everything, I may venture
to think of myself."</p>

<p>"Dice! What you say is all about gambling,
Edward."</p>

<p>"So it is, my sweetest. It is a trick I have got.
Chance is everything in business&mdash;luck, whatever
that may be: so that gambling words are the only
words that come natural. But don't leave the talking
to me; you can talk better than I can; you are not
a silent angel. Tell me something, Hester. Tell me
what you thought that night. Tell me what this
little heart is saying now."</p>

<p>Hester was not touched by that reference to her
little heart, which was not a little heart, but a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
one, bounding wildly in her breast with perplexity
and pain, as well as love, but ready for any heroic
effort.</p>

<p>"If I were to tell you perhaps you would not like
it, Edward. It makes me happy that you should
want me, and lean on me, and give me your burden
to bear; but I want so much more. Perhaps I am
not so gentle as women ought to be. My mother
would be content, but I am not. I want to know
everything, to help you to think, to understand it
all. And besides, Edward&mdash;&mdash;No, one thing is
enough; I will not say that."</p>

<p>"Yes, say everything; it is all sweet from you."</p>

<p>"Then, Edward, come home and let my mother
know. She will betray nobody. We ought not to
meet in the dark like two&mdash;&mdash;to send little hidden
notes. We are responsible to the people who love us.
We ought to be honest&mdash;to mamma, to Catherine
Vernon."</p>

<p>"We ought to go and hand in the banns, perhaps,"
he said, with sudden bitterness, "like two&mdash;honest
shopkeepers, as you say. Catherine Vernon would
give me away. And is this all you know of love,
Hester?&mdash;it is the woman's way, I suppose&mdash;congratulations,
wedding presents, general triumph over
everybody. How should you understand me when I
speak of disappearing with my love, getting lost,
dying even, if it were together&mdash;?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, for Hester was wounded, yet
touched, both to the heart. She said, after a moment,
almost under her breath, "I can understand that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
too." The faltering of her voice, the droop of her
head, and his own need for her, more urgent than
either, changed Edward's sarcastic mood. He drew
her closer to him, and put down his face close to
her ear.</p>

<p>"We must not fight," he said, "my only love. I
am going away, and I can't quarrel with you, my
only love! And I am your only love. There has
never been anybody between us. I will come back
in two or three days; but Hester, another time, if it
should be for good, would you come?&mdash;you would
come?&mdash;with me?"</p>

<p>"Elope!" she said, breathless, her eyes large in
the darkness, straining upon the face which was too
near her own to be very clear.</p>

<p>He laughed. "If you like the word; it is an
innocent word. Yes, elope then," he said.</p>

<p>"But why?&mdash;but why? It would wound them all&mdash;it
would break their hearts; and for what reason?"
Hester cried.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>ALARMS.</h3>


<p>Edward was about a week away from home. He
had often been away before, and his absence had
caused no particular commotion: but now it affected
a good many people. To Catherine, if it were
possible, it might be said to have been a certain
relief. He and she had got over that explanation
when she had intended to say so many things to him,
and had found the words taken out of her mouth.
All things had gone on again in their usual way. But
the suspicion which he had supposed to exist so long
without any reason now had actually arisen in her
mind. She showed it less than he had supposed her
to show it when she had no such feeling. She was
on her guard. She did not worry him any longer by
her old affectionate way of going to the window to
watch him when he went out; that had been simple
love, admiration of his orderly, regular ways, pleasure
in the sight of him: but somehow instinctively since
she had begun to doubt she came to perceive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
interpretation he had put upon it, and she did it no
longer. But at night when all was still in the house
and Edward down stairs at work in his room, or
supposed to be at work, if any sound of the door
closing echoed upwards, Catherine would steal behind
the curtains and watch if it was he who was going
out, and which way he took. She believed him, of
course; but yet there was always in her soul a wish
to ask&mdash;was he really, really sure that he was true?
Doubts like these are beyond the power of any but
the sternest self-command to crush, and Catherine
was capable of that in his presence. She would not
betray her anxiety to him: but when he was not
there no such effort was necessary, and she betrayed
it freely, to the silence, to the night, when there was
nobody to see.</p>

<p>And her thoughts had travelled fast and far since
that evening. She had no longer any doubt that he
loved somebody, and she had made up her mind that
it was Hester who was the object of his love. This
had caused her perhaps the greatest mental conflict
she had ever known in her life&mdash;for her life had this
good thing in it, that it had been wonderfully free
from struggle. She had been the arbiter of all
things in her little world, and nobody had made any
actual stand against her will. Many pretences had
surrounded her, feigned assents and furtive oppositions,
but nobody had stood out against her. It was
a great wonder to her that he or any one should do
so now (though he did not: he had opposed her
in nothing, nor ever said a word from which it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
be inferred that he rejected or questioned Catherine's
sway), but with all her natural strength of mind she
set herself to reconsider the question. If she disliked
Hester before, if for all these years the bright-eyed,
all-observant girl, mutely defiant of her, had been a
sort of Mordecai to Catherine, it is not to be supposed
that she could easily receive her into favour now.
Her parentage, her looks, her mind, her daring setting
up of her own personality as a child, as if she were
something important, had all exasperated Catherine.
Even the consciousness of her own prejudice, of the
folly of remembering against a girl the follies of
her childhood, helped to aggravate this sentiment;
nor was it likely that the fact that this girl was
Edward's chosen love should make her heart softer.
She said to herself that she could not endure Hester;
but yet she prepared herself for the inevitable from
the first day. Perhaps she thought it well to propitiate
fate by going to the very furthest length at
once, and forecasting all that the most evil fortune
could bring her.</p>

<p>It cost her a sharp and painful struggle. No one
knew what was going on in her mind in those wintry
days of the early year: her preoccupation was
attributed to other things: afterwards, when events
seemed to account for it, her wonderful prevision was
admired and wondered at. But in reality the previsions
in Catherine's mind were all of one kind. She
saw a series of events happen in succession, as to
which she was as confident as if they were past
already; and in her imagination she did the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
thing that nobody expected of her, the thing which
fate did not demand of her&mdash;she made up her mind
that she would make no stand against this hateful
thing. What was the use of it? If the young but
held out, even the most unwise and the most cruel,
they must win in the end. It would not be for her
dignity, she said to herself, to stand out. She would
make no opposition to Edward's choice. The separation
that must ensue she would bear as she could&mdash;with
dignity at least if nothing else. The elevation
of her enemy and her enemy's house she must submit
to. She would withdraw, she would have no hand in
it; but at least she would not oppose. This, by dint
of a hard fight, Catherine obtained of herself. She
would say nothing, forestall nothing, but at the same
time oppose nothing. All the long hours which a
lonely woman must spend by herself she appropriated
to this. She must lose Edward; had she not lost
him now? He had been her sole weakness, her one
delusion; and it was not, she said to herself, a delusion&mdash;the
boy had loved her and been true to her. He
had made her happy like a mother with a true son.
But when that vagrant sentiment comes in which is
called love (the fools! as if the appropriation of the
name to one kind of affection, and that the most
selfish of all, was not a scorn to love, the real, the
all-enduring!) what was previous virtue, what was
truth, and gratitude, and everything else in life, in
comparison? Of course they must all give place to
the fascination of a pair of shining eyes. Father
and mother, and home and duty, what were they in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
comparison? Everybody was aware of that, and the
old people struggled often enough as was well known.
Sometimes they appealed to heaven and earth, sometimes
were hysterical and made vows and uttered
curses. But in the long run the battle was to the
young ones. They had time and passion, and
universal human sympathy, on their side, whereas
the old people had none of all these, neither time to
wait, nor passion to inspire, nor sympathy anywhere
in heaven or earth. Catherine said to herself proudly
that she would not expose herself to the pity which
attends the vanquished. She would retire from the
fray. She would clothe herself in double armour of
stoicism, and teach herself to see the humour in this
as in so many things. Was not seeing the humour
of it the last thing that remained to the noble soul
amid the wonder of life?</p>

<p>Her sense, however, of this great downfall which
was approaching, and in which she meant to enact
so proud and magnanimous a part, was so strong and
bitter that Edward's absence was a relief to her.
She expected every day that he would present
himself before her, and burst forth into some agitated
statement&mdash;a statement which she would not
help out with a word, but which she would receive,
not as he would expect her to receive it, with opposition
and wrath, but with the calm of one who knew
all about it, and had made up her mind to it long
ago. But when he was absent she felt that here
was a respite. She was freed from the eager desire
she had, against her will, to know what he was doing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
where he went, who he was with, which tormented
her, but which she could not subdue. All this
ferment of feeling was stilled when he was away.
She did not ask why he should go away so often,
what the business was that called him to London.
For the first time in her life she was overmastered
by a conflict of individual feeling; and she was glad
when there came a lull in it, and when the evil day
was postponed. She went on seeing her friends,
visiting and being visited, keeping a fair face to the
world all the time. But it began to be whispered
in Redborough that Catherine Vernon was beginning
to fail, that there were signs in her of breaking up,
that she began to show her age. People began to
ask each other about her. "Have you seen Catherine
Vernon lately? How did you think she was
looking?" and to shake their heads. Some said she
had been so strong a woman always, and had taken
so much out of herself, that probably the break-up
would be speedy if it was true that she was beginning
to break up; while others held more hopefully
that with her wonderful constitution she might yet
rally, and see twenty-years of comfort yet. The fact
was that she was not ill at all. It seemed to herself
that she was more keenly alive, more highly strung
to every use of existence than ever. She saw better,
heard more quickly, having every sense on the alert.
Nothing had so quickened her and stimulated her
powers for years. She was eager for every new day
which might carry some new crisis in it. She did
not even feel the deadly chill of Edward's desertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
for the intense occupation which the whole matter
brought her. And then, though she said to herself
it was certain, yet it was not so certain after all.
It might turn out that she was mistaken yet.
There was still an outlet for a secret hope. Sometimes
indeed a flattering unction was laid to her
heart, a feeling that if it is only the unforeseen that
happens, the so carefully thought out, so elaborately
calculated upon, might not happen. But this Catherine
only permitted herself by rare moments. For
the most part she felt very sure of the facts, and
almost solemnly cognisant of what was to come.</p>

<p>In this way the spring went on. It had appeared
to Edward himself as certain that some great <i>coup</i>
must have settled his fate long before. It was his
inexperience, perhaps, and the excitement of his
determination to act for himself, which had made
everything appear so imminent; but after all it did
not turn out so. The course of events went on in
that leisurely current which is far more deadly in its
sweep than any sudden cataract. He did not lose or
gain anything in a moment, his ventures either did
not turn out so vast as he imagined, or they were
partial failures, partial successes. Step by step he
went on, sacrificing, jeopardising, gradually, slowly,
without being himself aware of what he was doing,
the funds he had under his control. He had been
ready in the first passion of his desire for wealth to
risk everything and finish the whole matter at one
swoop; but that passed over, and he was not really
aware how one by one his counters were being swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
out of his hands. It went on through all the
awakening time of the year, as it might have gone
on for half a life time, and he was impatient of the
delay. Besides, this new accompaniment, this love
which he would not have suffered himself to indulge
had he not believed everything on the eve of a crisis,
became a great addition to his difficulties when the
crisis did not come. The habit of resorting to
Hester was one which grew upon him. But the
opportunities of indulging in it were few, for he was
as anxious not to betray himself nor to let Catherine
suspect what was going on, as at the beginning, when
he believed that all would be over in a week or two.
And Hester herself was not a girl with whom it was
easy to carry on a clandestine intercourse. The
situation chafed her beyond endurance. She had
almost ceased now to think of the mystery in which
he hid his proceedings, or to rebel against the interest
and sympathy which he demanded from her blindly,
out of the keen humiliation and distress which it
cost her to feel that she was deceiving her friends
and the world, conspiring with him to deceive
Catherine. This consciousness made Hester disagreeable
to live with, an angry, resentful, impatient
woman, absorbed in her own affairs, little accessible
to the world. Her mother could not understand
what had come to her, and still less could the old
Morgans, who loved and had understood her so
completely, understand. She avoided them now, she
cared for nobody. Week by week with a joyless
regularity she went to Ellen Merridew's dances, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
half the evening at least was spent with Edward in
a curious duel of mingled love and dislike&mdash;yes,
sometimes hatred almost. It seemed to her that her
distaste for everything that was going on was more
than her love could balance, that she so hated the
expedients he drove her to, that he himself took
another aspect in her eyes. Sometimes she felt that
she must make the crisis which he had so often
anticipated, and instead of consenting to fly with
him must fly by herself, and cut the tie between
them with a sharp stroke. It was all pain, trouble,
misery&mdash;and what was worse, falsehood, wherever
she turned. As the year slid round into sunshine,
and the days grew longer, everything became intolerable
to Hester. His absence was no relief to her.
She had his secret to keep whether he was there
or away, or rather her secret: for nothing she felt
could be so dreadful to her as the secresy in which
her own life was wrapped, and which he was terrified
she should betray.</p>

<p>And though it was now nearly six months after
Christmas, Emma Ashton still lived with the old
Morgans, and pursued her adventures with her bow
and spear in the dances and entertainments of the
neighbourhood. Reginald Merridew so far from
"speaking" had been sent off by his father to
America, professedly on business, but, as was well
known in the family, to put a stop to the nonsense
which at his age was so utterly out of the question;
and though other expectations had stirred her from
time to time, nothing had given certainty to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
hopes of being settled. She was going home at last,
to Roland, in the beginning of June, and the old
people were looking forward to their deliverance with
no small impatience. Emma never failed at the
<i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i>. The old fly with the white horse
rumbled along in the dusk of the early summer
nights and mornings, carrying these two young
women to and fro almost as regularly as the Thursday
came&mdash;Hester reluctant, angry, and pale, obeying
a necessity which she resented to the very depths of
her being; Emma placid, always with a certain sense
of pleasure animating her business-like arrangements.
Catherine, who did not sleep very well on these
nights, got to recognise the sound, and would sometimes
look out from her window and wonder bitterly
whether <i>that girl</i> too was glancing out, perhaps with
triumph in her eyes as she passed the shut-up house,
thinking of the day when it would be her own. It
gave her a little pleasure on the first of June when
she heard the slow vehicle creeping by to think that
Edward had been called away that afternoon, and
that if Hester had expected to meet him she would
be disappointed. That was a little consolation to
her. She heard it creeping back again about one in
the morning, earlier than usual, with a satisfied smile.
There had been no billing and cooing that evening,
no advance made towards the final triumph. She
thought there was a sound of disappointment even
in the rumble of the fly; and so indeed there might
have been, for Emma was sobbing, and discoursing
among her tears upon the sadness of her prospects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
It was the last <i>Th&eacute; Dansante</i> to which Emma could
hope to go. "And here I'm going just as I came,"
Emma said, "though I had such a good opening, and
everybody has been so kind to me. I can't say here
that it has been for want of having my chance. I
have been introduced to the best people, and grandmamma
has given me two new dresses, and you have
never grudged me the best partners, I will say that
for you, Hester; and yet it has come to nothing! I
am sure I sha'n't be able to answer Roland a word
if he says after this that balls are an unnecessary
expense&mdash;for it is not much I have made by them.
To think that not one single gentleman in all
Redborough&mdash;&mdash;! Oh, Hester, either Elinor and
Bee tell awful stories of what happened to them, or
things have changed dreadfully, quite dreadfully,
since their day!"</p>

<p>Hester could find no words in which to console
this victim of the times. She listened indeed somewhat
sternly, refusing compassion. "To be sure,
there was poor Reginald, it was not his fault," Emma
sobbed. "If I should live to be a hundred I never
should believe it was his fault. But, after all, he
was very young, and he could have had no money to
speak of, and what should I have done with him?
So perhaps that was for the best. But then there
was Dr. Morris, whom I could have got on with; that
was his mother's doing:&mdash;ladies are always jealous,
don't you think?&mdash;and I should not have minded
that Captain Sedgely, that volunteer captain. But
it is of no use talking, for this is my last Thursday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Oh, you don't mind; you have a good home, and a
mother, and everything you can desire. There is no
hurry about you."</p>

<p>Hester made no reply. It seemed to her that she
would be willing to change lives even with Emma, to
fall to her petty level, and estimate the chances of
being settled, and count the men whom she could
have managed to get on with, rather than carry on
such an existence as hers. It was no glance of
triumph, but one of humiliation, that she had cast, as
they passed, upon the shuttered windows and close-drawn
white draperies at the Grange. In her imagination
she stole into the very bedchamber where
Catherine had smiled to think of her disappointment,
and delivered her soul of her secret. "I am not
ashamed that we love each other: but I am ashamed
that we have concealed it," she imagined herself
saying. She was very unhappy; there seemed no
consolation for her anywhere. Edward had warned
her in a hurried note that he was called to town. "I
think it is coming at last," he said. "I think we
have made the grand <i>coup</i> at last." He had said it
so often that she had no faith in him; and how long
was it to go on like this&mdash;how long?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the house of the young Merridews was
still ringing with mirth and music. There was no
restraint, or reserve, or prudence or care-taking, from
garret to basement. Algernon, the young husband
who was now a father as well, had perhaps taken a
little more champagne than usual in honour of his
wife's first re-appearance after that arrival. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
so brave, so "plucky," they all said, so unconventional,
that she had insisted on the <i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i> going on
all the same, though she was unable to preside over
them, and was still up, a little pale but radiant with
smiles, at the last supper-table when every one was
gone. Harry had been looking very grave all the
evening. He had even attempted a little lecture
over that final family supper. "If I were you, Algy
and Nell," he said, "I'd draw in a little now. You've
got your baby to think of&mdash;save up something for
that little beggar, don't spend it all on a pack of
fools that eat you up."</p>

<p>"Oh, you old Truepenny," Ellen said, without
knowing what she meant, "you are always preaching.
Hold your tongue, Algy, you have had too
much wine; you ought to go to bed. If I can't
stand up for myself it's strange to me. Who are
you calling a pack of fools, Harry? It's the only
thing I call society in Redborough. All the other
houses are as stiff as Spaniards. There is nobody
but me to put a little life into them. They were all
dead-alive before. If there's a little going on now I
think it's all owing to me."</p>

<p>"She is a wonderful little person is Nell," cried
her husband, putting a half-tipsy arm round her.
"She has pluck for anything. To think she should
carry on just the same, to let the rest have their
pleasure when she was up stairs. I am proud of her,
that is what I am. I am proud&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go to bed, Algy! If you ever do this again
I will divorce you. I won't put up with you. Harry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
shut up," said the young mistress of the house,
who was fond of slang. "I can look after my own
affairs."</p>

<p>"And as for the money," said Algy, with a jovial
laugh, "I don't care a &mdash;&mdash; for the money. Ned's
put me up to a good thing or two. Ned's not very
much on the outside, but he's a famous good fellow.
He's put me up," he said, with a nod and broad smile
of good humour, "to two&mdash;three capital things."</p>

<p>"Ned!" cried Harry, almost with a roar of terror
and annoyance, like the cry of a lion. "Do you mean
to say you've put yourself in Ned's hands?"</p>

<p>Upon which Ellen jumped up, red with anger, and
pushed her husband away. "Oh, go to bed, you
stupid!" she cried.</p>

<p>Harry had lost all his colour; his fair hair and
large light moustache looked like shadows upon his
whiteness. "For God's sake, Ellen!" he said; "did
you know of this?"</p>

<p>"Know of what?&mdash;it's nothing," she cried. "Yes,
of course I know about it. I pushed him into it&mdash;he
knows I did. What have you got to do with
where we place our money? You may be sure we
sha'n't want you to pay anything for us," she said.</p>

<p>Harry had never resented her little impertinences;
he had always been submissive to her. He shook
his head now more in sorrow than in anger. "Let's
hope you won't want anybody to pay for you," he
said, and kissed his sister and went away.</p>

<p>Harry had never been in so solemn a mood before.
The foolish young couple were a little awed by it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
but at last Ellen found an explanation. "It's ever
since he was godfather to baby. He thinks he will
have to leave all his money to him," she said; and
the incident ended in one of Algy's usual bursts of
laughter over his wife's <i>bons mots</i>.</p>

<p>Harry, however, took the matter a great deal more
seriously; he got little or no sleep that night. In
the morning he examined the letters with an alarmed
interest. Edward was to be back that evening, it
was expected, and there was a mass of his letters on
his desk with which his cousin did not venture to
interfere. Edward had a confidential clerk, who
guarded them closely. "Mr. Edward did not think
there would be anything urgent, anything to trouble
you about," he said, following Harry into the room
with unnecessary anxiety. "I can find that out for
myself," Harry said, sharply, turning upon this furtive
personage. But he did not meddle with any of the
heap, though it was his right to do so. They frightened
him, as though there had been infernal
machines inside, as indeed he felt sure enough
there were&mdash;not of the kind which tear the flesh
and fibre, but the mind and soul. When he went
back to his room he received a visit very unexpectedly
from the old clerk, Mr. Rule, with whom
Hester had held so long a conversation on the
night of the Christmas party. It was his habit to
come now and then, to patronise everybody, from the
youngest clerks to the young principals, shaking his
white head and describing how things used to be "in
John Vernon's time." Usually nobody could be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
genial and approving than old Rule. He liked to
tell his story of the great crisis, and to assure them
that, thanks to Miss Catherine, such dangers were no
longer possible. "A woman in the business just
once in a way, in five or six generations," he thought
an admirable institution. "She looks after all the
little things that you young gentlemen don't think
worth your while," he said. But to-day Mr. Rule
was not in this easy way of thinking. He wanted to
know how long Edward had been gone, and where he
was, and when he was expected back? He told
Harry that things were being said that he could not
bear to hear. "What is he doing away so often?
Is it pleasure? is it horse-racing, or that sort of
thing? Forgive me, Mr. Harry, but I'm so anxious
I don't know what I'm saying. You have always
taken it easy, I know, and left the chief management
to Mr. Edward. But you must act, sir, you must act,"
the old clerk said.</p>

<p>Harry's face had a sort of tragic helplessness in it.
"He's coming back to-night&mdash;one day can't matter
so much. Oh, no, it's not horse-racing, it's business.
Edward isn't the sort of fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One day may make all the difference," cried the
old man, but the more fussy and restless he was, the
more profound became Harry's passive solemnity.
When he had got rid of the old clerk he sat for a
long time doing nothing, leaning his head in his
hands: and at last he jumped up and got his hat,
and declared that he was going out for an hour.
"Several gentlemen have been here asking for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Edward," he was told as he passed through the outer
office. "Mr. Merridew, sir, the old gentleman: Mr.
Pounceby: and Mr. Fish has just been to know for
certain when he will be back." Harry answered
impatiently what they all knew, that his cousin
would be at the bank to-morrow morning, and that
he himself would return within the hour. There
were some anxious looks cast after him as he went
away, the elder clerks making their comments. "If
Mr. Edward's headpiece, sir, could be put on Mr.
Harry's shoulders," one of them said. They had no
fear that <i>he</i> would be absent when there was any
need for him, but then, when he was present, what
could he do?</p>

<p>Harry went on with long strides past the Grange
to the Heronry; it was a curious place to go for
counsel. He passed Catherine sitting at her window,
she who once had been appealed to in a crisis and
had saved the bank. He did not suppose that things
were so urgent now, but had they been so he would
not have gone to Catherine. He thought it would
break her heart. She had never been very kind to
him, beyond the mere fact of having selected him
from among his kindred for advancement; but Harry
had a tender regard for Catherine, a sort of stolid
immovable force of gratitude. His heart melted as
he saw her seated in the tranquillity of the summer
morning in the window, looking out upon everything
with, he thought, a peaceful interest, the contemplative
pleasure of age. It was not so, but he thought
so&mdash;and it seemed to him that if he could but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
preserve her from annoyance and disturbance, from
all invasion of rumour or possibility of doubt as to the
stability of Vernon's, that there was nothing he would
not endure. He made himself as small as he could,
and got under the shadow of the trees that she might
not observe him as he passed, and wonder what
brought him that way, and possibly divine the
anxiety that was in him. He might have spared
himself the trouble. Catherine saw him very well,
and the feeling that sprang up in her mind was
bitter derision, mixed with a kind of unkindly
pleasure. "If you think that <i>you</i> will get a look
from her, when she has <i>him</i> at her feet?" Catherine
said to herself, and though the idea that Hester had
<i>him</i> at her feet was bitter to her, there was a pleasure
in the contempt with which she felt Harry's
chances to be hopeless indeed. She was very ungrateful
for his kindness, thinking of other things,
quite unsuspicious of his real object. She smiled
contemptuously to see him pass in full midday when
he ought to have been at his work, but laughed, with
a little aside, thinking, poor Harry, he would never
set the Thames on fire, it did not matter very much
after all whether he was there or not. The master
head was absent, too often absent, but Edward had
everything so well in hand that it mattered the less.
"When he is settled he will not go away so often,"
she said to herself. What a change it would have
made in all her thoughts had she known the gloomy
doubts and terrors in Harry's mind, his alarmed sense
that he must step into a breach which he knew not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
how to fill, his bewildered questionings with himself.
If Edward did not turn up that night there would be
nothing else for it, and what was he to do? He
understood the common course of business, and how
to judge in certain easy cases, but what to do in an
emergency he did not know. He went on to the
Heronry at a great rate, making more noise than any
one else would with the gate, and catching full in his
face the gaze of those watchful observers who belonged
to the place, Mr. Mildmay Vernon in the
summer-house with his newspaper, and the Miss
Vernon-Ridgways at their open window. He
thought they all rose at him like so many serpent-heads
erecting themselves with a dart and hiss.
Harry was so little fanciful that only an excited
imagination could have brought him to this.</p>

<p>Mrs. John was in the verandah, gardening&mdash;arranging
the pots in which her pelargoniums were
beginning to bloom. She would have had him stay
and help her, asking many questions about Ellen and
her baby which Harry was unable to answer.</p>

<p>"Might I speak to Hester?" he said. "I have
no time to stay; I would like to see her for a
moment."</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Mrs. John. Harry's embarrassment,
she thought, could only mean one thing&mdash;a
sudden impulse to renew the suit which Hester
had been so foolish as to reject. She looked at him
kindly and shook her head. "She is in the parlour;
but I wouldn't if I were you," she said, her eyes
moist with sympathy. It was hard upon poor Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
to be compelled thus to take upon himself the credit
of a second humiliation.</p>

<p>"I should like to see her, please," he answered,
looking steadfastly into Mrs. John's kind, humid eyes,
as she shook her head in warning.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear boy; she is in the parlour. I
wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;&mdash; But, alas! there is no change
in her, and I wouldn't if I were you."</p>

<p>"Never mind, a man can but have his chance,"
said magnanimous Harry. He knew that few men
would have done as much, and the sense of the
sacrifice he was making made his heart swell. His
pride was to go too; he was to be supposed to be
bringing upon himself a second rejection; but
"Never mind, it is all in the day's work," he said
to himself, as he went through the dim passages and
knocked at the parlour door.</p>

<p>Hester was sitting alone over a little writing-desk
on the table. She was writing hurriedly, and he
could see her nervous movement to gather together
some sheets of paper, and shut them up in her little
desk, when she found herself interrupted. She gave
a great start when she perceived who it was, and
sprang up, saying, "Harry!" breathlessly, as if she
expected something to follow. But at first Harry
was scarcely master of himself to speak. The girl
he loved, the one woman who had moved his dull,
good, tenacious heart&mdash;she whom, he thought, he
should be faithful to all his life, and never care for
another; but he knew that her start, her breathless
look, the colour that flooded her face, coming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
going, were not for him, but for some one else, and
that his question would plunge her into trouble too;
that he would be to her henceforth as an emissary of
evil, perhaps an enemy. All this ran through his
mind as he stood looking at her and kept him silent.
And when he had gathered himself together his
mission suddenly appeared to him so extraordinary,
so presumptuous, that he did not know how to
explain it.</p>

<p>"You must be surprised to see me," he said,
hesitating. "I don't know what you will think.
You will understand I don't mean any impertinence,
Hester&mdash;or prying, or that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will mean to be kind, Harry; but
tell me quick&mdash;what is it?" she cried.</p>

<p>He sat down opposite, looking at her across the
table. "It is only from myself&mdash;nobody's idea but
mine; so you need not mind. It is just this, Hester,
in confidence. Do you know where Edward is? It
sounds impertinent, I know, but I don't mean it.
He's wanted so badly at the bank. If you could
give me an address where I could telegraph to him?
Don't be vexed; it is only that I am so stupid about
business. I can do nothing out of my own head."</p>

<p>"Is anything going wrong?" she cried, her lips
quivering, her whole frame vibrating, she thought,
with the beating, which was almost visible, of her
heart.</p>

<p>"Well, things are not very right, Hester. I don't
know how wrong they are. I've been kept out of it.
Oh, I suppose that was quite natural, for I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
much good. But if I could but telegraph to him at
once, and make sure of getting him back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think, Harry&mdash;I have heard&mdash;oh, I can't tell
you how! he is coming back to-night."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure? I know he's expected, but
then&mdash;&mdash; So many things might happen. But if
he knew how serious it was all looking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her look as she sat gazing at him was so terrible
that he never forgot it. He did not understand it
then, nor did he ever after fully understand it. The
colour had gone entirely out of her face; her eyes
stared at him as out of two deep, wide caves. It
was a look of wonder, of dismay, of guilt. "Is he
wanted&mdash;so much?" she said. Her voice was no
more than a whisper, and she gave a furtive glance
at the door behind her as if she were afraid some one
might hear.</p>

<p>"Oh, wanted&mdash;yes! but not enough to make you
look like that. Hester, if I had thought you'd
have felt it so! Good Lord, what can I do? I
thought you might have told me his address. Don't
mind, dear," cried the tender-hearted young man.
"I've no right to call you dear, but I can't help it.
If it's come to this, I'd do anything for him, Hester,
for your sake."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind me, Harry&mdash;it is&mdash;nothing. I
have got no address: but I know&mdash;he's coming
to-night."</p>

<p>"Then that's all right," Harry said. "I wanted to
make sure of that. I don't suppose there is anything
to be frightened about so long as he is on the spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
you know&mdash;he that is the headpiece of the establishment.
He is such a clear-headed fellow, he sees
everything in a moment, and he has got everything
on his shoulders. It's not fair, I know. I must try
and shake myself up a little and take my share, and
not feel so helpless the moment Ned's away&mdash;that's
all," he said, getting up again restlessly. "I have
only given you a fright and made you unhappy; but
there's no reason for it, I assure you, Hester, so long
as Ned is to be here."</p>

<p>What he said did not comfort her at all, he could
see. Her face did not relax nor her eyes lose their
look of horror. He went away quite humbly, not
saying a word to Mrs. John, who on her part gave
him a silent, too significant, pathetic grasp of her
hand. Harry was half tempted to laugh, but a great
deal more to weep, as he went back again to Redborough.
He reflected that it was hard upon a fellow
to have to allow it to be supposed that he had offered
himself to a girl a second time when he was doing
nothing of the kind. But then he thought of Hester's
horrified look with a wonder and pain unspeakable,
not having the remotest idea what such a look might
mean. Anyhow, he concluded, Edward was coming
home. That was the one essential circumstance
after all.</p>

<h3>THE CRISIS.</h3>


<p>Hester sat still after Harry had left her as if she
had been frozen to stone. But stone was no fit
emblem of a frame which was tingling in every
nerve, or of a heart which was on fire with horror
and anguish and black bewilderment. The look
which Harry could not understand, which stopped
him in what he was saying, and which even now he
could not forget&mdash;was still upon her face. She was
contemplating something terrible enough to bring a
soul to pause, a strange and awful solution of her
mystery; and the first glance at it had stunned her.
When she had assured him that Edward was coming
back that night, a hurried note which she had
received that morning seemed to unfold itself in the
air before her, where she could read it in letters as
of fire. It was written on a scrap of paper blurred,
as if folded while the ink was still wet:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The moment has come that I have so long foreseen.
I am coming home to-morrow for a few hours.
Meet me at dusk under the holly at the Grange gate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
The most dangerous place is the safest; it must be
for ever or no more at all. Be ready, be calm, we
shall be together, my only love.&mdash;E. V."</p>

<p>This was how she knew that he was coming back.
God help her! She looked in Harry's face, with an
instantaneous realisation of the horror of it, of the
falsehood that was implied, of her own sudden complicity
in some monstrous wrong. "I know he is
coming home to-night." What was it that turned
Medusa into that mask of horror and gave her head
its fatal force? Was it the appalling vision of some
unsuspected abyss of falsehood and treachery suddenly
opening at her feet, over which she stood
arrested, turned into an image of death, blinding
and slaying every spectator who could look and see?
Hester did not know anything about classic story,
but she remembered vaguely about a face with
snaky locks that turned men to stone. She told
Harry the truth, yet it was a cruel lie. She herself,
though she knew nothing and was tortured with
terror and questionings, seemed to become at once
an active agent in the dark mystery, a liar, a traitor,
a false friend. Harry looked at her with concern
and wonder, seeing no doubt that she was pale, that
she looked ill, perhaps that she was unhappy, but
never divining that she was helping in a fatal deceit
against her will, contrary to her every desire. He did
not doubt for a moment what she said, or put any
meaning to it that was not simply in the words. He
never dreamt that Edward's return was not real, or
that it did not at once satisfy every question and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
things if not right, yet in the way of being right.
He drew a long breath of relief. That was all he
wanted to know. Edward once back again at the
head of affairs, everything would resume its usual
course. To hear him say "Then that's all right!"
and never to say a word, to feel herself gazing in his
eyes&mdash;was it with the intention of blinding those
eyes and preventing them from divining the truth?
or was it in mere horror of herself as the instrument
of a lie, of him, him whom she would fain have
thought perfect, as falsehood incarnate? There was
a moment when Hester knew nothing more, when,
though she was on fire and her thoughts like flame,
lighting up a wild world of dismay about her, she
yet felt as if turned into stone.</p>

<p>The note itself when she received it, in the quiet
freshness of the morning, all ordinary and calm, her
mother scarcely awake as yet, the little household
affairs just beginning, those daily processes of cleaning
and providing without which no existence can be&mdash;had
been agitation enough. It had come to her
like a sudden sharp stroke, cutting her loose from
everything, like the cutting of a rope which holds a
boat, or the stroke that severs a branch. In a
moment she was separated from all that soft established
order, from the life that had clasped her all
round as if it would hold her fast for ever. Her
eyes had scarcely run over those hurried lines before
she felt a wild sensation of freedom, the wind in her
face, the gurgle of the water, the sense of flight.
She put out her hands to screen herself, not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
carried off by the mere breeze, the strong-blowing
gale of revolution. A thrill of strange delight, yet
of fright and alarm, ran through her veins&mdash;the
flood of her sensations overwhelmed her. Its suddenness,
its nearness, its certainty, brought an intoxication
of feeling. All this monotony to be over;
a new world of adventure, of novelty, of love, and
daring and movement, and all to begin to-night.
These thoughts mounted to her head in waves.
And as the minutes hurried along and the world
grew more and more awake, and Mrs. John came
down stairs to breakfast, the fire in Hester's veins
grew hotter and hotter. To-night, in the darkness&mdash;for
ever or no more at all. It seemed incredible that
she could contain it all, and keep her secret and make
no sign. All this time no question of it as of a matter
on which she must make up her mind, and in which
there was choice, had come into her thoughts. She
was not usually passive, but for the moment she received
these words as simple directions which there
could be no doubt of her carrying out. His passion
and certainty took possession of her: everything
seemed distinct and necessary&mdash;the meeting in the
dusk, the hurried journey, the flight through the darkness.
For great excitement stops as much as it accelerates
the action of the mind. Her thoughts flew out
upon the wind, into the unknown, but they did not
pause to discuss the first steps. Had he directed her
to do all this at once, in the morning instead of in the
dusk, she would have obeyed his instructions instinctively
like a child, without stopping to inquire why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>But this mood was changed by the simplest of
domestic arguments. Mrs. John, fresh and smiling
in her black gown and her white cap, came down to
breakfast. Not a suspicion of anything out of the
ordinary routine was in Mrs. John's mind. It was a
lovely morning; the sunshine pleased her as it did
the flowers who hold up their heads to it and open
out and feel themselves alive. Her chair was on the
sunny side of the table, as it always was. She liked
to sit in it and be warmed by it. She began to talk
of all the little household things as she took her
tea; of how the strawberries would soon be cheap
enough for jam. That was the one thing that remained
in Hester's mind years after. In a moment,
while her thoughts were full of a final and sudden
flight, that little speech about the jam and the
strawberries brought her to herself. She felt herself
to come back with a sudden harsh jarring and
stumbling to solid ground. "The strawberries!"
she said, looking at her mother with wild eyes of
dismay as if there had been something tragic in
them. "In about a fortnight, my dear, they will be
quite cheap enough," Mrs. John said, with a contented
nod of her head. In a fortnight! a fortnight!&mdash;a
century would not mean so much. A fortnight
hence what would the mother be thinking, where
would the daughter be? Then there came to Hester
another revelation as sudden, as all-potent as the
first&mdash;that it was Impossible&mdash;that she must be mad
or dreaming. What! fly, go away, disappear, whatever
might be the word? She suddenly laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
out, her mother could not tell why, dropping a china
cup, over which Mrs. John made many lamentations.
It broke a set, it was old Worcester, worth a great
deal of money. It had been her grandmother's.
"Oh, my dear, I wish you would not be so careless!"
But of anything else that was broken, or of the
mystery of that sudden laugh which corresponded
with no expression of mirth on Hester's face, Mrs.
John knew nothing. Impossible! Why there was
not a word to be said, not a moment's hesitation. It
could not be&mdash;how could it be? Edward, a young
man full of engagements, caught by a hundred bonds
of duty, of work, of affection&mdash;why, if nothing else,
of business&mdash;to whom it was difficult to be absent
for a week, who had sometimes to run up and down
to town in twenty-four hours&mdash;that he should be able
to go away! He must mean something else by it,
she said to herself; the words must bear a second
signification. And she herself, who had no business,
or duty, or tie of any sort except one, but that one
enough to move heaven and earth, her mother&mdash;who
in a fortnight would be making the jam if the strawberries
were cheap enough. The thought moved her
to laughter again, a laugh out of a strangely solemn,
excited countenance. But this sudden revulsion of
feeling had given the whole matter a certain grotesque
mixture of the ludicrous: it demonstrated
the impossibility of any such overturn with such a
sarcastic touch. Hester said to herself that she
must have been nearly making some tragical
mistake, and compromising her character for good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
sense for ever. Of course it was impossible. Whatever
he meant by the words he did not mean that.</p>

<p>After breakfast, when she was alone and had read
the note over again, and could find no interpretation
of it but the first one, and had begun to enter into
the agonies of a mental struggle, Hester relieved
the conflict by putting it down on paper&mdash;writing to
Edward, to herself, in the first instance, through him.
She asked him what he meant, what other sense
there was in his words which she had not grasped?
He go away! how could he, with Catherine trusting
in him, with Vernon's depending upon him, with his
work and his reputation, and so much at stake; and
she with her mother? Did not he see that it was
impossible? Impossible! He might say that she
should have pointed this out before, but she had
never realised it; it had been words to her, no more;
and it was words now, was it not? words that meant
something beyond her understanding&mdash;a test of her
understanding; but she had no understanding it
appeared. Hester thought that she would send this
letter to await him when he reached the Grange,
and then she would keep his appointment and find
him&mdash;ready to laugh at her, as she had laughed at
herself. She put it hurriedly into her desk when
Harry appeared, with a guilty sense that Harry, if
he saw it, would not only divine whom it was
addressed to, but even what it said. But Harry
was no warlock, and though he saw the hurried
movement and the withdrawal of the papers, never
asked himself what it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>But after Harry was gone, she wrote no more.
She gave one glance at the pages full of anxious
pleading, of tender remonstrances, of love and perplexity;
then closed the lid upon them, as if it
had been the lid of a coffin, and locked it securely.
They were obsolete, and out of date, as if her grandmother
had written them. They had nothing to do
with the real question; they were as fictitious as if
they had been taken out of a novel. All that she
had said was foolishness, like the drivelling of an
idiot. Duty! she had asked triumphantly, how
could he disengage himself from that? how could
she leave her mother behind?&mdash;when, great heaven!
all that he wanted was to shake duty off, and get rid
of every tie. Harry's revelation brought such a
contrast before her, that Hester could but stare at
the two pictures with dumb consternation. On one
side the bank in gloomy disarray, its ordinary course
of action stopped, the business "all wrong," poor
people besieging its doors for their money, the clerks
bewildered, and not knowing what to do; and poor
Harry faithful, but incapable, knowing no better
than they. On the other, Edward, in all a bridegroom's
excitement, with the woman he loved beside
him, travelling far away into the night, flushed with
pleasure, with novelty, with the success of his actions
whatever they were, and with the world before him.
It seemed to Hester that she saw the two scenes,
although she herself would have to be an actor in
one of them if it ever came to pass. She saw them
to the most insignificant details. The bank (Vernon's&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
sheet-anchor of the race, for which she herself
felt a hot partisanship, a desire to build it up with the
prop of her own life if that would do it), full of angry
and miserable people cursing its very name&mdash;while
the fugitives, with every comfort about them, were
fast getting out of sight and hearing of everything
that could recall what they had left. Deserter!
traitor! Were these the words that would be used?
and was he going to fly from the ruin he had made?
That last most terrible question of all began to force
itself to her lips, and all the air seemed to grow
alive and be filled with darting tongues and voices
and hissings of reply. And then it was that Hester
felt as if her very hair began to writhe and twist in
living horror about her shoulders, and that her eyes,
wide with fright and terror, were becoming like
Medusa's, things that might turn all that was living
to stone.</p>

<p>But to think through a long summer day is a
terrible ordeal, and many changes and turns of the
mind are inevitable. It was a pitiless long day,
imagine it! in June, when not a moment is spared
you. It was very bright, all nature enjoying the
light. The sun seemed to stand still in the sky, as
on that day when he stopped to watch the slaughter
in Ajalon; and even when he disappeared at last,
the twilight lasted and lingered as if it would never
be done.</p>

<p>Hester had put away her long letter of appeal, but
she wrote a brief, almost stern note, which she sent
to the Grange in the early evening. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Harry has told us that all is going wrong at the
bank, that you are wanted urgently there, that only
you can set things right. You cannot have known
this when you wrote to me. I take it for granted
this changes everything, but I will come to-night to
the place you name."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She sent her note in the afternoon, and then
waited, like a condemned criminal, faintly hoping
still for a reprieve; for perhaps to know this would
stop him still; perhaps he had not known it. She
went out just after sunset, escaping not without
difficulty from her mother's care.</p>

<p>"It is too late for you to go out by yourself," Mrs.
John said. "I do not like it. You girls are so
independent. I never went beyond the garden by
myself at your age."</p>

<p>"I am only going to the Common," Hester said, with
a quiver in her voice. She kissed her mother very
tenderly. She was not in the habit of bestowing caresses,
so that this a little startled Mrs. John; but she
returned it warmly, and bade her child take a shawl.</p>

<p>Did Hester think she might yet be carried away
by the flood of the other's will, against her own, that
she took her leave so solemnly? It was rather a
sort of imaginative reflection of what she might
have been doing if&mdash;&mdash; She had gone but a little
way when she met Captain Morgan.</p>

<p>"Why did not you tell me you were going out?"
he said. "I have tired myself now; I can't go with
you. I have been inquiring about the midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
train for Emma, who did not get off this morning
after all."</p>

<p>"Is she going by the midnight train?" Hester
asked, with a sense of inconvenience in it that she
could hardly explain.</p>

<p>"Yes, if it is possible to get her off," said the
captain; "but, my dear, it is too late for you to
walk alone."</p>

<p>"No, oh no. It is only for this once," Hester
cried, with involuntary passion unawares.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" said the old man. He was disturbed
by her looks. "I will go in and get an
overcoat, and join you directly, Hester; for though
I am tired I would rather be over-tired than that
you should walk alone."</p>

<p>The only way that Hester could defend herself
was to hurry away out of sight before he came out
again. She had a dark dress, a veil over her face.
Her springy step indeed was not easy to be mistaken,
nor the outline of her alert and vigorous
figure, which was so much unlike loitering. She
got away into the fields by a lonely path, where she
could be safe she thought till the time of her
appointment came. What was to happen at that
appointment she could not tell. Excitement was
so high in her veins that she had no time to ask
herself what she would answer him if he kept to his
intention, or what she should do. Was it on the
cards still that she might follow him to the end of
the world?</p>

<p>Edward had arrived late, only in time for dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
He got Hester's note and read it with an impatient
exclamation.</p>

<p>"The little fool," he said to himself, "as if that
was not the very&mdash;&mdash;" and tore it in a thousand
pieces. He dressed for dinner very carefully, as
was his wont, and was very pleasant at table, telling
Catherine various incidents of his journey. "You
must make the most of me while you have me," he
said, "for I have a pile of letters in my room that
would make any one ill to look at. I must get
through them to-night&mdash;there may be something
important. It is a pity Harry doesn't take more
of a share."</p>

<p>"I think for my part it is one of the best things
about him," said Catherine, "that he always acknowledges
your superiority. He knows he will never
set the Thames on fire."</p>

<p>"And why should he?" said Edward: "a man may
be a very good man of business without that. I
wish he would go into things more; then he would
always be ready in case of an emergency."</p>

<p>"What emergency?" said Catherine, almost
sharply. "You are too far-seeing, I think."</p>

<p>"Oh, I might die, you know," said Edward, with
an abrupt laugh.</p>

<p>"Anything might happen," she said; "but there
are many more likely contingencies to be provided
for. What is that?" she added quickly.</p>

<p>The butler had brought in and presented to
Edward upon a large silver salver which called
attention to it, a small, white, square object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Return tickets, ma'am," said the butler solemnly,
"as dropped out of Mr. Edward's overcoat."</p>

<p>"Return tickets! you are not going back again,
Edward?"</p>

<p>"I am always running up and down, Aunt Catherine.
I constantly take return tickets," he said
quietly, pocketing the tickets and giving the butler
a look which he did not soon forget. For there
were two of them, which Marshall could not understand.
As for Catherine, this gave her a little pang,
she could not tell why. But Edward had never
found so much to tell her before. He kept her
amused during the whole time of dinner. Afterwards
he took her up stairs into the drawing-room
and put her into her favourite chair, and did everything
that a tender son could have done for her
comfort. It was growing dusk by this time, and he
had not been able to keep himself from giving a
glance now and then at the sky.</p>

<p>"Do you think we are going to have a storm,
Edward?" Catherine asked.</p>

<p>"I think it looks a little like it. You had better
have your window shut," he said.</p>

<p>He had never been more kind. He kissed her
hand and her cheek when he went away, saying it
was possible if his letters were very tough that he
might not come up stairs again before she went
to bed.</p>

<p>"Your hand is hot," she said, "my dear boy. I
am afraid you are a little feverish."</p>

<p>"It has been very warm in town, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
always best, you know, in country air," was what
he said.</p>

<p>She sat very quietly for some time after he had
left her, then seeing no appearance of any storm,
rose and opened her window again. He was almost
too careful of her. As she did so she heard a faint
sound below as of some one softly closing the door.
Was it Edward going out notwithstanding his letters?
She put herself very close to the window to watch.
He had a small bag in his hand, and stood for a
moment at the gate looking up and down; then he
made a quick step beyond it as if to meet some one.
Catherine watched, straining her eyes through the
gloom. She was not angry. It brought all her
fears, her watchfulness, back in a moment. But if
it was true that he loved Hester, of course he must
wish to see her&mdash;if she was so unmaidenly, so unwomanly
as to consent to come out like this to
meet him. And was it at her own very door that
the tryst was? This roused Catherine. She heard
a murmur of voices on the other side of the great
holly. The summer night was so soft, every sound
was carried by the air. Here was her opportunity
to discover who it was. She did not pause to think,
but taking up her shawl in her hand threw it over
her head as she stole down stairs. It was black and
made her almost invisible, her dress being black too.
She came out at a side door, narrowly escaping the
curiosity of Marshall. The bright day had fallen into
a very dim evening. There was neither moon nor
stars. She stole out by the side door, avoiding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
path. Her footsteps made no sound on the grass.
She crossed the gravel on tiptoe, and wound her way
among the shrubberies till she stood exactly under
the holly-tree. The wall there was about up to a
man's shoulders; and it was surmounted by a railing.
She stood securely under the shadow of it, with her
heart beating very loudly, and listened to their
voices. Ah, there could be no doubt about it. She
said to herself that she never had any doubt. It
was the voice of <i>that girl</i> which answered
Edward's low, passionate appeals. There are some
cases in which honour demands a sacrifice scarcely
possible. She had it in her power to satisfy herself
at once as to the terms upon which they were, and
what they expected and wished for. She had no
intention of eavesdropping. It was one of the sins
to which Catherine was least disposed; but to turn
back without satisfying herself seemed impossible
now.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>UNDER THE HOLLY.</h3>


<p>It seemed to Hester that she had been for hours
out of doors, and that the lingering June evening
would never end. Now and then she met in the
fields a party of Redborough people taking a walk&mdash;a
mother with a little group of children, a father
with a taller girl or boy, a pair of lovers. They all
looked after her, wondering a little that a young
lady, and one who belonged to the Vernons (for
everybody knew her), should be out so late alone.
"But why should she not have a young man too?"
the lovers thought, and felt a great interest in the
question whether they should meet her again, and
who <i>he</i> might be. But still it could not be said to be
dark&mdash;the wild roses were still quite pink upon the
hedges. The moments lingered along, the clocks
kept chiming by intervals. Hester, by dint of long
thinking, felt that she had become incapable of all
thought. She no longer remembered what she had
intended to say to him, nor could divine what he
would say. If it were but over, if the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
would but come! She felt capable of nothing but
that wish; her mind seemed to be running by her
like a stream, with a strange velocity which came to
nothing. Then she woke up suddenly to feel that
the time had come. The summer fields all golden
with buttercups had stolen away into the grey, the
hedgerows only betrayed themselves by a vague
darkness. She could not see the faces, or anything
but ghostlike outlines of those she met. The time
had come when one looks like another, and identity
is taken away.</p>

<p>There was nobody upon the Grange road. She
went along as swift as a shadow, like a ghost, her
veil over her face. The holly-tree stood black like a
pillar of cloud at the gate, and some one stood close
by waiting&mdash;not a creature to see them far or near.
They clasped hands and stood together enveloped by
the greyness, the confused atmosphere of evening,
which seemed to hide them even from each other.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven I have you at last. I thought
you were never coming," Edward said.</p>

<p>"It was not dark enough till now. Oh, Edward!
that we should meet like thieves, like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lovers, darling. The most innocent of lovers
come together so&mdash;especially when the fates are
against them; they are against us no more, Hester.
Take my arm, and let us go. We have nothing
to wait for. I think I have thought of everything.
Good-bye to the old life&mdash;the dreary, the vain. My
only love! Come, there is nothing to detain us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the secret listener&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
came without any intention of listening, who
wanted only to see who it was and what it meant&mdash;losing
her shoe in the heavy ground of the shrubbery,
stole into that corner behind the wall.</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward, wait&mdash;there is everything to detain
us. Did you not get my note? They say things
are going wrong with Vernons&mdash;that the bank&mdash;&mdash;I
can't tell what it is, but you will understand. Harry
said nothing could be done till you came."</p>

<p>"Harry is a fool!" he said, bitterly. "Why didn't
he take his share of the work and understand matters?
Is it my fault if it was all thrown into my hands?
Hester, you are my own love, but you are a fool too!
Don't you see? Can't you understand that this is
the very reason? But why should I try to explain
at such a moment&mdash;or you ask me? Come, my
darling! Safety and happiness and everything we
can wish lie beyond yon railway. Let us get away."</p>

<p>"I am not going, Edward. Oh, how could you
think it! I never meant to go."</p>

<p>"Not going!" he laughed, and took her hands
into his, with an impatience, however, which made
him restless, which might have made him violent,
"that is a pretty thing to tell me just when you
have met me for the purpose. I know you want to
be persuaded. But come, come; I will persuade
you as much as you can desire when I get you safe
into the train."</p>

<p>"It is not persuasion I want. If it was right I
would go if all the world were against it. Edward,
do you know what it looks like? It looks like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
treachery&mdash;like deserting your post&mdash;like leading
them into danger, then leaving them in their
ignorance to stumble out as they can."</p>

<p>"Well?" he said. "Is that all? If we get off
with that we shall do very well, Hester. I shouldn't
wonder if they said harder things still."</p>

<p>"If the bank should&mdash;come to harm. I am a
Vernon too. I can't bear it should come to harm.
If anything was to happen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it will abridge this discussion&mdash;which surely
is ill-timed, Hester, to say the least&mdash;I may admit at
once that it is likely to come to harm. I don't know
how things are to be tided over this time. The
bank's on its last legs. We needn't make any
mystery on the subject. What's that?"</p>

<p>It was a sound&mdash;of intolerable woe, indignation,
and wrath from behind the wall. Catherine was
listening, with her hands clasped hard to keep herself
up. It was not a cry which would have betrayed
her, but an involuntary rustle or movement, a gasp,
indistinguishable from so many other utterances of
the night.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was nothing," he added. "Hester,
come; we can't stand here like two&mdash;thieves, as you
say, to be found out by anybody. There's that
villain Marshall, Catherine's spy, always on the outlook.
He tells his mistress everything. However,
that does not matter much now. By to-morrow,
dear, neither you nor I need mind what they say.
There will be plenty said&mdash;we must make up our minds
to that. I suppose you gave your mother a hint&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"My mother, a hint? Edward! how could I dare
to say to her&mdash;What would she think? but oh,
that comes so long a way after! The first thing is,
you cannot go; Edward, you must not go, a man
cannot be a traitor. It is just the one thing&mdash;If
all was plain sailing, well; but when things are going
badly&mdash; Oh no, no, I will not hear you say so. You
cannot desert your post."</p>

<p>He took hold of her arm in the intensity of his
vexation and rage.</p>

<p>"You are a fool," he said, hoarsely. "Hester! I
love you all the same, but you are a fool! Didn't I
tell you at first I was risking everything. Heavens,
can't you understand! Desert my post! I have no
post. It will be better for them that I should be out
of the way. I&mdash;must go&mdash;confound it! Hester, for
God's sake, haven't you made up your mind! Do
you know that every moment I stand here I am in
danger? Come! come! I will tell you everything
on the way."</p>

<p>She gave a cry as if his pressure, the almost force
he used to draw her with him, had hurt her. She
drew her hand out of his.</p>

<p>"I never thought it possible," she said, "I never
thought it possible! Oh, Edward! danger, what is
danger? There's no danger but going wrong. Stop:
my love&mdash;yes, you are my love&mdash;there has never been
any one between us. If you have been foolish in
your speculations, or whatever they are, or even
wrong&mdash;stay, Edward, stay, and put it right. Oh, stay,
and put it right! There can be no danger if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
will stand up and say 'I did it, I will put it right;'
and I&mdash;if you care for me&mdash;I will stand by you
through everything. I will be your clerk; I will work
for you night and day. There is no trouble I will
not save you, Edward. Oh, Edward, for God's sake,
think of Catherine, how good she has been to you;
and it will break her heart. Think of Vernon's,
which we have all been so proud of, which gives us
our place in the country. Edward, think of&mdash;Won't
you listen to me? You will be a man dishonoured,
they will call you&mdash;they will think you&mdash;Edward!"</p>

<p>"All this comes finely from you," he cried,
"beautifully from you! You have a right to set up
on the heights of honour, and as the champion of
Vernon's. You, John Vernon's daughter, the man
that ruined the bank."</p>

<p>"The man that&mdash;&mdash; Oh, my God! Edward, what
are you saying&mdash;my father! the man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed out&mdash;laughed aloud, forgetting
precautions.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you did not know&mdash;the man
that was such a fool, that left it a ruin on Catherine's
hands? You did not know why she hated you?
You are the only one in the place that does not. I
have taken the disease from him, through you; it
must run in the blood. Come, come, you drive me
into heroics too. There is enough of this; but
you've no honour to stand upon, Hester; we are in
the same box. Come along with me now."</p>

<p>Hester felt that she had been stricken to the
heart. She drew away from him till she got to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
rough support of the wall, and leant upon it, hiding
her face, pressing her soft cheek against the roughness
of the brick. He drew her other arm into his,
trying to lead her away; but she resisted, putting
her hand on him, and pushing him from her with all
her force.</p>

<p>"There is not another word to be said," she cried.
"Go away, if you will go; go away. I will never
go with you! All that is over now."</p>

<p>"This is folly," he said. "Why did you come here
if you had not made up your mind? And if I tell
you a piece of old news, a thing that everybody
knows, is that to make a breach between us?
Hester! where are you going? the other way&mdash;the
other way!"</p>

<p>She was feeling her way along the wall to the
gate. It was very dark, and they were like shadows,
small, vague, under the black canopy of the tree.
She kept him away with her outstretched arm which
he felt rather than saw.</p>

<p>"I never knew it&mdash;I never knew it," she said, with
sobs. "I am going to Catherine to ask her pardon
on my knees."</p>

<p>"Hester, for God's sake don't be a fool&mdash; To
Catherine! You mean to send out after me, to stop
me, to betray me! but by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The oath never got uttered, whatever it was.
Another figure, tall and shadowy, appeared behind
them in the opening of the gate. Edward gave one
startled look, then flung from him the hand of Hester
which he had grasped unawares, and hurried away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
towards the town, with the speed of a ghost. He
flung it with such force that the girl's relaxed and
drooping figured followed, and she fell before the
third person, the new comer, and lay across the
gateway of the Grange, half stunned, not knowing
at whose feet she lay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Edward hastened onward like a ghost speeding
along the dark road. He was miserable, but the
greatest misery of all was to think that even now at
the last moment he might be brought back&mdash;he
might be stopped upon the edge of this freedom for
which he longed. He wanted Hester, he wanted happiness,
and he had lost them&mdash;but there was still freedom.
Had there been only the risks of the crisis, the
meeting of alarmed and anxious creditors, the chance
even of criminal prosecution, he might have faced it;
but to return again to that old routine, to take up
his former life, was impossible. He flew along like
the wind. There was still an hour or more before
the train would start. Would the women gather
themselves together, he wondered, soon enough to
send after him, to prevent his journey? As much
to avoid that risk as to occupy the time, which he
did not know what else to do with, he resolved to
walk to the junction, which was at a distance of two
or three miles. So strange is the human constitution,
that even at this tragic and sombre moment he
almost enjoyed the dark night walk, though it was
that of a fugitive; the present is always so near us,
so palpable, so much more apparent than either the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
future or the past. He arrived at the junction just
in time, and jumped into the first carriage he could
find in his hurry. He had no luggage, having left
everything in town&mdash;nothing but the small bag in his
hand, in which there were various things which he had
meant to show to Hester, to amuse her, distract her
thoughts on the night journey, and keep her from
too many questions. Among these things was a
special licence, which he had procured that morning
in town. He jumped into the carriage without
perceiving there was any one in it; and it annoyed
him to see, when he settled in the furthest corner, that
there was a woman in the other. But the light was
low, and it could not be helped. Thus shut up in
close and silent company, two strangers, each
wrapped in a world of their own, they went swinging
through the night, the lights of the stations on the
road gleaming past, while with a roar and rush they
ran through covering sheds and by empty platforms.
After a while Edward's attention was caught, in
spite of himself, by a little measured sob and sigh,
which came at intervals from the other corner. The
lady was very quiet, but very methodical. She put
back her veil; she took out her handkerchief; she
proceeded to dry her eyes in a serious matter-of-fact
way. Edward could not help watching these little
proceedings. A few minutes after, with a start, he
perceived who his companion was. Emma, going
home at last, just as she came, no one having spoken,
nor any event occurred to change the current of her
life. Her little sniff, her carefully-wiped-off tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
were for her failure, and for the dulness of Kilburn,
which she was about to return to. A sudden idea
struck Edward's mind. He changed his seat, came
nearer to her, and at last spoke.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Miss Ashton, you don't like travelling
by night," he said.</p>

<p>She gave a little start and cry. "Oh, is it you, Mr.
Edward? I thought when you came in, it must be
somebody I knew. Oh, I am afraid you must have
seen me crying. I am very sorry to go away; everybody
in Redborough has been so kind to me, and
there is always so much going on."</p>

<p>"But in London&mdash;&mdash;" Edward began.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is what everybody says. There is
always so much going on in London. That just
shows how little they know. Perhaps among the
fashionable sets. I don't know anything about that;
but not in Kilburn. It's partly like a little village,
and partly like a great huge town. You're not supposed
to know the people next door; and then they
are all just nobody. The men come home to their
dinner or their tea, and then there is an end of them.
When you are in the best set in a place it makes
such a difference. Roland is very kind, and I have
nothing to complain of, but I can't bear going back.
That's what I was crying for: not so much for having
to leave, but for having to go back."</p>

<p>"You are tired of your life too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so I am! but it can't be helped. I must
just go back to it, whether I like it or not."</p>

<p>"Would you be glad of an alternative?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Edward. He spoke with a sort of wanton recklessness,
not caring what became of him.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Emma, waiting upon providence,
"that is a different thing; perhaps it would be
better not: I can't tell. Yes, I think I should, if
you ask me. Anything new would be a blessing;
but where am I to look for anything new? You see,
Roland has his own engagements; you never can
interfere with a brother."</p>

<p>It took away her breath when Edward rose from
the opposite side where he was and came and sat
beside her. "I am going away too," he said; "I
want change too. I can't bear the quiet any longer.
I want to travel. Will you come with me? We
could be married to-morrow morning and start
immediately after&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Edward! good gracious!" cried Emma. It
took away her breath. This was coming to the point
indeed. "Was this what you were thinking of when
you asked me to dance the Thursday before last?
I never thought of such a thing. I thought it was
Hester. Goodness me, what would they all say?
Did you know I was coming to-night? Were you
only pretending about Hester? Were you struck
with me from the beginning, or only just at the last?
I am sure I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>"Come with me, that is the best thing to do,"
Edward said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>THE HOUR OF NEED.</h3>


<p>Catherine stood upon the threshold of her own
gate: her house still and vacant behind, the lamps
just carried into the vacant place up stairs, the
windows beginning to show lights. She stood, herself
a shadow, for the moment regardless of the
shadow at her feet, looking out into the dim world
after the other shadow which went along swift and
silent into the darkness. "Edward!" she cried; but
he did not hear. He had disappeared before she
turned her eyes to the other, who, by this time, had
raised herself to her knees, and remained there looking
up, her face a paleness in the dim air, nothing
more. Catherine Vernon looked at her in silence.
She had heard all that had been said. She had
heard the girl plead for herself, and it had not
touched her heart. She had heard Hester beaten
down to the ground by the reproach of her father's
shame, and a certain pity had moved her. But a
heart, like any other vessel, can contain only what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
can contain. What time had she to think of Hester?
what room? Edward had been her son, her creed;
whoso proved that he was not worthy of faith even
in Catherine's interest was her enemy; everything
else came in a second place. He had stabbed and
stabbed her, till the blood of those wounds seemed
to fill up every crevice in her being. How could she
think of a second? She looked after him with
a cry of sorrow and anger and love that would
not die. "Edward!" No doubt he could explain
everything&mdash;he could tell her how it was, what
had happened, what was the meaning of it all. Only
when he was gone, and it was certain that he meant
to explain nothing, did she turn to the other. They
looked at each other, though neither could see
anything but that paleness of a face. Then Catherine
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you are not hurt, get up and come in. I have
to ask you&mdash;there are things to explain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not hurt: he did not throw me down," said
Hester, "it was an accident."</p>

<p>Catherine made an impatient gesture. She did
not even help the girl to get up; the dislike of so
many years, raised to the tragic point by this association
with the most terrible moment of her life,
was not likely to yield in a moment, to give way to
any sense of justice or pity. She motioned to her
to follow, and led the way quickly into the house.
The great door was ajar, the stairs and passages still
dark. They went up, one shadow following another,
without a word. In the drawing-room Marshall had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
just placed the two shaded lamps, and was closing
the windows. His mistress called to him to leave
them as they were, and sat without speaking until,
after various flittings about the room, he went away.
Then she hastily raised the shade from the lamp
upon her own table, throwing the light upon her
own face and the other. They were both very pale,
with eyes that shone with excitement and passion.
The likeness between them came out in the strangest
way as they stood thus, intent upon each other.
They were like mother and daughter standing
opposed in civil war. Then Catherine sat down and
pointed Hester to another chair.</p>

<p>"We are not friends," she said, "and I don't think
I can ever forgive you; but you are young, and
perhaps you are strained beyond your strength. I
would not be cruel. Will you let me give you
something to restore you, or will you not, before
you speak? for speak you must, and tell me what
this means."</p>

<p>"I want nothing," said Hester. "If I should be
killed, what would it matter? I recognise now that
I have no right to your kindness&mdash;if that was
true&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was true."</p>

<p>"Then I ask your pardon," said the girl, folding
her hands. "I would do it on my knees, but you
would think that was&mdash;for effect. I should think
so myself in your place. You do right to despise
us: only this&mdash;oh, God help us, God help us&mdash;I
never knew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Girl," cried Catherine roughly, "the man you
love (I suppose) has just fled away, so far as I can
see, dishonoured and disgraced, and leaving you for
ever! And yet you can stop to think about effect.
I do not think you can have any heart."</p>

<p>Hester made no reply. She had reached that
point which is beyond the heights of sensation. She
had felt everything that heart could feel. There
were no more tears in her, nor anger nor passion of
any kind. She stood speechless, let any one say
what they would to her. It might all be true.</p>

<p>"I do not think you can have any heart," cried
her passionate opponent. "If it had been me at
your age, and I had loved him, when he threw me
from him so, I should have died."</p>

<p>There came a ghost of an awakening on Hester's
face, a sort of pitiful smile of acquiescence. Perhaps
it might be so. Another, more finely tempered,
more impassioned, more high and noble than she,
might have done that: but for her, poor soul, she
had not died. She could not help it.</p>

<p>Catherine sat in her seat as in a throne, with a
white face and gleaming eyes, and poured forth her
accusations.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," she said, "for my part! for
now you will be queen's evidence, which it is fit and
right your father's daughter should be. Do not
stand there as if I had put you on your trial.
What is it to me if you have any heart or not? I
want information from you. Sit down there and
husband your strength. How long has this been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
going on? It was not the first time he had talked
to you of flying, oh no. Tell me honestly: that will
be making some amends. How long has this been
going on?"</p>

<p>Hester looked at her with great liquid eyes,
dewy in their youthfulness and life, though worn
with fatigue and pain. She asked in a low, wondering
voice, "Did you hear all we said?"</p>

<p>"I heard&mdash;all, or almost all. Oh, you look at me
so to accuse me, a listener that has heard no good
of herself! I am not sorry I did it. It was without
intention, but it was well. I can answer for myself.
Do you answer for yourself. How long has it been
going on?"</p>

<p>Hester stood still, clasping and unclasping her
hands. She had nobody to appeal to, to stand by
her: this was a kind of effort to get strength from
herself. And her spirit began to come back. The
shock had been terrible, but she had not been
killed. "What can I say to you beyond what I
have said," she cried, "if you heard what we said?
There was no more. His life has been intolerable
to him for a long time; the monotony, the bondage
of it, has been more than he could bear. He has
wanted change and freedom&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hester thought she was making excuses for Edward.
She said all this quickly, meaning to show that these
were innocent causes for his flight, motives which
brought no guilt with them. She was brought to a
sudden pause. Catherine, who had been gazing at
her when she began with harsh, intent earnestness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
suddenly threw up her hands with a low cry of
anguish. She sank back into her chair and covered
her face. The girl stood silenced, overawed, her lips
apart, her eyes wide staring. The elder woman had
shown no pity for her anguish. Hester, on her side,
had no understanding of this. She did not know
that this was the one delusion of Catherine's soul.
Miss Vernon had believed in no one else. She had
laughed and seen through every pretence&mdash;except
Edward. Edward had been the sole faith of her later
life. He had loved her, she believed; and she had
been able to give him a life worthy of him. Heaven
and earth! She had heard him raving, as she said
to herself, outside. The boy had gone wrong, as, alas,
so many have gone: out of a wicked, foolish love,
out of a desire to be rich, perhaps. But this was
different. A momentary temptation, even a quick
recurring error, that can be understood. But that
his life should have been intolerable, a monotony,
a bondage, that change had been what he longed for&mdash;change
from her house, her presence, her confidence!
She gave vent to a cry like that of a wild animal, full
of horror and misery and pain. The girl did not mean
to hurt her. There was sincerity in every tone of
her voice. She thought she was making his sins
venial and defending him. Oh, it was true, true!
Through Catherine's mind at that moment there ran
the whole story of her later days, how she had used
herself to the pretences of all about her, how every
one around had taken from her, and snarled at her,
eaten of her bread, and drunk of her cup, and hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
her&mdash;except Edward. He alone had been her prop,
her religion of the affections. The others had sneered
at her weakness for him, and she had held her head
high. She had prided herself on expecting no gratitude,
on being prepared, with a laugh, to receive evil
for good&mdash;except from him. Even now that she
should be forced to acknowledge him ungrateful, that
even would have been nothing, that would have done
her no hurt. But to hear that his past life had been
a burden, a bondage, a monotony, that freedom was
what he longed for&mdash;freedom from her! The whole
fabric of her life crushed together and rocked to its
foundations. She cried out to Heaven and earth that
she could not bear it&mdash;she could not bear it! Other
miseries might be possible, but this she could not
endure.</p>

<p>Hester stood motionless, arrested in what she had
to say. She did not understand the sudden effect of
her words; they seemed to her very common words,
nothing particular in them: certainly no harm. She
herself had experienced the monotony of life, the
narrowness and bondage. But as she stood silenced,
gazing, there came over her by degrees a faint comprehension;
and along with this a sudden consciousness
how strange it was that they should be both
heartbroken on one subject and yet stand aloof from
each other like enemies. It was not possible to mistake
that cry&mdash;that sudden gesture, the hiding of
Catherine's face. Whatever was the cause of it, it
was anguish. And was there not cause enough?
For a moment or two, Hester's pride kept her back&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
had been already repulsed. But her heart was
rent by trouble of her own. She made a step or two
forward, and then dropped upon her knees, and
touched Catherine's arm softly with a deprecating,
half-caressing touch.</p>

<p>"Oh, Catherine Vernon!" she cried, "we are both
in great trouble. We have not been fond of each
other; but I am sorry, sorry, for you&mdash;sorry to the
bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>Catherine made no reply. The shock was too
great, too terrible and overwhelming. She could not
answer nor show that she heard even, although she
did hear in the extraordinary tension of her faculties.
But Hester continued to kneel beside her. Youth
is more simple than age even when it is most self-willed.
The girl could not look on and refuse to be
touched, and she herself wanted fellowship, human
help or even human opposition, something different
from the loneliness in which she was left. She
touched Catherine's arm with her hand softly two or
three times, then after a while in utter downfall and
weakness drooped her forehead upon it, clasping it
with both her hands, and sobbed there as upon her
mother's breast. The room was perfectly still, stretching
round them, large and dim: in this one corner
the little steadfast light upon the group, the mother
(you would have said) hiding her face from the light,
hiding her anguish from both earth and Heaven,
the daughter with that clinging which is the best
support, giving to their mutual misery the pathetic
broken utterance of tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine was the first to rouse herself. The spasm
was like death, but it came to an end. She tried to
rise with a little wondering impatience at the obstacle.
It was with the strangest sensation that she turned
her eyes upon the hidden head lying so near her
own, and felt, with an extraordinary thrill, the arms
clasped round her arm, as if they never would detach
themselves. What new thing was this? Hester had
lost all her spirit and power. She had got within the
sphere of a stronger than she. She was desolate, and
she clung to the only arm that could sustain her.
Catherine's first impulse was to snatch her arm away.
What was this creature to her&mdash;this girl who one
way or other had to do with everything that had
happened to her, and was the cause of the last
blow? She could have flung her away from her
as Edward had done. But the second glance moved
her more and more strangely. The helplessness had
an appeal in it, which would not be resisted. It even
did her the good office of withdrawing her thoughts
for a moment from the emergency which claimed
them all. She half rose, then fell back again and
was silent, not knowing what to do. What appeal
could be more strong than that of those arms so
tightly holding her own? She tried to speak
harshly, but could not. Then an impulse she could
not resist, led her to lay her other hand upon the
drooping head.</p>

<p>"Hester," she said, gravely, "I understand that you
are very unhappy. So am I. I thank you for being
sorry for me. I will try, in the future, to be sorry for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
you. But just now, understand, there is a great deal
to do. We must stand between&mdash;him," her voice
faltered for a moment, then went on clear as before,
"between him and punishment. If he can be saved
he must be saved; if not, we must save what we can.
You have overcome me, I cannot put you from me.
Free me now, for I have a great deal to do."</p>

<p>She had felt, by the closer straining of the clasping
arms, that Hester heard every word. Now the girl
raised her face, pale, with a look of terror.</p>

<p>"What can you do? Are you able to do it?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Able!" said Catherine, raising herself upright
with a sort of smile. "I am able for everything that
has to be done. Child, get up and help me! Don't
cry there and break my heart."</p>

<p>Hester stumbled to her feet in a moment. She
could scarcely stand, but her heart sprang up like a
giant&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will do&mdash;whatever you tell me," she said.</p>

<p>Catherine rose too. She put away her emotion
from her as a workman clears away all encumbering
surroundings. She made the girl sit down, and went
out of the room and brought her some wine.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, "we may help each other; at
all events we have a common interest, and we have
no time to give to lamentations to-night. The first
thing is&mdash;but your mother will be unhappy about
you. What shall I do? Shall I send her word that
you are here and staying with me all night? Your
mother is a happier woman than you or I. She will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
accept the reason that is given her without questioning.
Probably she will be pleased. Be calm and
rest yourself. I will do all that is needful."</p>

<p>She went to her writing-table and began to write,
while Hester, shattered and broken, looked on.
Catherine showed no signs of disablement. The butler
came in in his stealthy way while she was writing,
and asked if he must "shut up." She said&mdash;"No,"
going on with her writing. "You will go, or send
some one, at once to the Heronry with this note. And
afterwards you can go to bed. I wish no one to sit
up. I expect news, for which I must wait myself.
Let all go to bed as usual. No, stop. Go to the
White House also and tell Mr. Harry&mdash;What do you
think, Hester? is it worth while to call Harry?"</p>

<p>She turned round with the clear eyes and self-controlled
aspect of use and wont. Even Marshall,
who had the skill of a well-trained domestic in spying
out internal commotion, was puzzled. She seemed to
be asking a question on a matter of business in which
the feelings were no ways involved. Hester was not
equal to the call upon her, but she made a great effort
to respond.</p>

<p>"He is very&mdash;anxious."</p>

<p>Catherine made a movement with her footstool
which partly drowned the last word.</p>

<p>"You can wait a little, Marshall. I will write a
note to Mr. Harry too."</p>

<p>The two letters were written at full speed, and
given with a hand as steady as usual into the man's
keeping. "Let them be taken at once," Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
said. Then she began to walk up and down the room
talking in her usual tones. "Don't mind me pacing
about&mdash;it is a habit I have. I can talk best so. It is
my way of taking exercise now." She went on until
Marshall was out of hearing, then turned upon Hester
with a changed tone. "He meant to take you away
by the midnight train," she said. "That was so? He
cannot leave Redborough till then. I am going to
meet him there, and endeavour to persuade him to
return. Quiet, child! This is not the moment for
feeling. I&mdash;feel nothing," she said, putting her hand
as nature bids with a hard pressure upon her heart.
"We have got to do now. Are you strong enough to
come with me, or must I go alone?"</p>

<p>Hester rose up too, quickly, with a start of new
energy. "I can do anything that you will let me
do," she said.</p>

<p>"Come, then." But after a moment Catherine
put her hands on the girl's shoulders, and drew her
into the light. "You are very young," she said, "not
twenty yet, are you? Poor little thing! I was full
grown before I was brought to this. But show what
metal is in you now. Come with me and bathe your
face and put yourself in order. We must have no
look of excitement or trouble to bring suspicion.
Everything is safe as yet. What? Do you know
anything more?"</p>

<p>"I know only&mdash;what I said," said Hester. "Harry
is very anxious. He came to ask if I knew where&mdash;<i>he</i>
was. I did not. He said all was wrong, that no
one could put things right but he, that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Catherine said, with a little impatience;
she could not bear any repetitions. "I have told
Harry to come here at half-past twelve. If we find
<i>him</i>, if <i>he</i> comes back with us&mdash;here is your work,
Hester, to see Harry and dismiss him. If Edward is
with us, all will be well. If he comes, if he only
comes! Oh God! I will deny nothing. I will
oppose nothing, let but honour be saved and his
good name! And in that case you will see Harry
and send him away. But if he does not come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He will, he will!&mdash;for you."</p>

<p>Catherine shook her head; but a faint smile came
over her face, a kindling of hope. Surely, surely the
old love&mdash;the old long-enduring bond, would tell for
something. It could not be possible that he would
throw everything&mdash;love and duty, and honour, and
even well-being&mdash;all away&mdash;when there was still a
place of repentance held out to him. She took
Hester to her room, where she dressed herself carefully,
tying on her bonnet, and drawing out the bows
with an elaboration at which the girl looked on
wondering. Then they went down stairs where all
was now in half light, one lamp burning dimly in
the hall. As Catherine drew the heavy door behind
her it sent a muffled echo into the air. It was after
eleven o'clock. The world was wrapped in a soft
darkness more confusing than blacker night: there
was not a creature visible on the road. She had not
walked, save for her pleasure, in the sunshine just so
far as was agreeable, for years, and it was far to go.
To Hester this strange walk through the dark was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
once novel and terrible. She did not know what
interruptions they might meet. She kept close by
her companion, who went along with a free and rapid
step, as if she had shaken off half her weight of
years. Deep down in the recollection of many a
woman of whom the world knows no such history
will lurk the recollection of such a walk taken in
terror and sorrow, to call back some wanderer, to
stop some shame. The actors in such scenes never
speak of them, though they may be the noblest in
their lives. Catherine said something not uncheerful
from time to time, keeping up her own courage as
well as her companion's. Nobody noticed them as
they came within the lighted streets, which were
deserted at this late hour, except round the railway
station, where Catherine sped along without a pause.
The train had not arrived; there were a number of
people about upon the platform waiting for it, among
them a little group composed of Emma and her
trunks, with old Captain Morgan standing like a
pillar in the midst of the confused heap. "Wait
here and watch," Catherine said, putting Hester into
a quiet corner, where the girl stood trembling, gazing
at the shifting groups, hardly able to sustain her
fatigued and tottering limbs, but following with a
kind of fascination the movements of her companion,
who seemed to penetrate every knot, to scan every
countenance, not a creature there escaping her
inspection.</p>

<p>If he had been there, would all this page of history
have been changed, and wrong become right again?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
These strange turns for good or evil, that seem to
hang upon the quiver of a balance, are too bewildering
for mortal senses. Catherine by that time had no
doubt. Had she but found him, quivering with love
and strength and passion as she was, she would have
saved him still. But he was not there. She made
no affectation of secresy. She called the guard to her,
and gave him a succinct reason for wishing to find
her nephew. "Some news have come for him since
he left the house. Find him for me," she said, with
a smile, and a half-crown ready. But by and by she
came back to the girl in the corner, reproving her
with an impatient touch on her shoulder. "Don't
look so scared," she said. "What is there to be
frightened for?" She took hold of Hester by the
arm. She was trembling from head to foot: for by
this time she knew that he was not there.</p>

<p>There was still the chance left that he might dart
in at the last moment, and it was for this reason that
she placed herself by the doorway, her face full in
the lamplight, with a smile upon it, her look of expectation
frank and cheerful. Then came the deafening
clang of the arrival, the confusion and bustle and
leave-takings, the little pause full of voices and
noises, and then the clang of the train getting under
way, the sweep and wind of its going, the emptiness
and blackness left behind: all so vulgar and ordinary,
yet all tragic sometimes as the most terrible of accessories.
She drew Hester aside almost violently,
and let the other spectators stream away. Among
the first old Captain Morgan stalked forth, tired but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
contented, noticing nobody. Of all people in the
world he would least have recognised these two
standing in agitation inconceivable, subduing as they
could the heart-throbs that took away their breath.
When he had got well on his way the two women
came out into the light. They were holding by each
other, Hester clasping her companion's arm, and
guiding her as she had once guided her mother. A
sombre cloud had come over Catherine's face. She
had allowed herself to hope, and the second disappointment
was almost worse than the first revelation.
It was all her self-command could do to
prevent her from flinging off from her the girl whose
share in all this&mdash;what was it? perhaps the whole
was her doing, perhaps the suggestion of everything,
perhaps, God knows, craft enough to make this final
effort to recover the boy a failure. Who could say if
Hester had not known from the beginning that the
attempt would be fruitless? And the other, too,
Harry, whom she had called to her by an impulse
which seemed now to have been put into her head
by some one, and not to be her own. Harry, too.
He would be brought into the secret! Her humiliation
would be complete. The boy she had scoffed at,
the girl she had disliked, turned into her confidants,
and Edward, her own, her heir, her son, the successor
she had chosen!&mdash;Catherine's heart cried out within
her with a mother's passion. In the quiet of the
country road she could hold her peace no longer.
She drew her arm out of Hester's abruptly.</p>

<p>"No doubt," she said, "no doubt! he was to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
you away, a fine lady like you, with posthorses in a
romantic way&mdash;not by the vulgar method of a train;
and you have deceived me, and lost me my last
chance. Edward! Edward! Oh where are you, my
boy, my boy?"</p>

<p>Here, had she but known it, poor Catherine's
comedy of human nature was complete. Edward,
upon whom she called with tragic passion as great as
that of a Constance, was just then approaching
Emma, in a fierce farce of self-compensation, determined
to make the adventure complete, to cut
every tie and tear every remnant of the past to
pieces. Her laugh of contempt at the poor farce-tragedy
would have been supreme had it been any
case but her own.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>A NIGHT'S VIGIL.</h3>


<p>They had been sitting through all the night,
examining everything. Catherine was not a woman
to be the slave of passion, even when that was the
one delusion of her life. She got over it with a stern
and fierce struggle before they reached the gate of
the Grange, whither Hester followed her, trembling
and half stupefied, unable either to resist or to think
of any course of action for herself. Catherine paused
at the gate, and looked round her with a curious
quivering smile. "Here is where I saw him going
away," she said; "here is where I heard the last
words from him." She laughed; her heart was
throbbing with the wildest suffering. She dashed
her hands together with a violence of which she was
unaware. "Such words!" she cried. It was scarcely
one o'clock, but in summer there is little night, and
already the air had begun to whiten with some premonition
of day. She held up her face to the sky&mdash;an
old face, with so many lines in it, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
smitten as with a death-blow. Her eyes, under the
curve of pain, which makes the eyelids quiver, looked
up to the pale skies with what is the last appeal of
humanity. For why?&mdash;for why?&mdash;an honest life, an
honourable career, a soul that had shrunk from no
labour or pain, a hand that never had been closed to
human distress&mdash;and repaid with misery at the end!
Is there no reason in it when God's creature lifts a
face of anguish to His throne, and asks why? She
paused on the threshold of her house, which was
desolate, and made that mute appeal. It was beyond
all words or crying, as it was beyond all reply. The
other, who was the companion of her misfortune,
stood beside her, looking, not at heaven, but at her.
Hester had got far beyond thinking of her own share
in it. Fatigue and excitement had brought sensation
almost to an end. She was not angry with Catherine,
who had thrown her off. Everything was blurred to
her in a sense of calamity common and universal, of
which Catherine seemed the sign and emblem. She
made no interruption in the silence. And it was
only when Catherine turned to go in that she was
recalled to a recollection of Hester by her side.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;I had better go home&mdash;to my mother,"
the girl said, looking along the road with a dreamy
terror. She was afraid of the dark, the solitude, the
distance&mdash;and yet what was there left to her but to
go home, which she seemed to have quitted, to have
fled from, with the idea of never returning, years ago.
Catherine put out her hand and grasped her. She
was far the more vigorous of the two. She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
have carried the girl into the house, where she now
half led, half dragged her. They found Harry
already waiting for them in great bewilderment and
distress. He could not account for the entrance of
these two together, or for their apparent union&mdash;but
Catherine gave him no explanation. She made him
sit down and tell her at once everything he knew of
the state of affairs: and when this was made plain
to her, she flew out upon him with a wrath that
made Harry shrink.</p>

<p>"Why did you leave everything in one person's
hands? Is it not a partner's business to look after
his own interests? You have piled all upon one
man's shoulders. He has had everything to do. It
has been too much for his mind&mdash;it has turned his
head. If it had been yours, what would have
happened to you?"</p>

<p>"I have been saying all that to myself, Aunt
Catherine," Harry said, humbly; "but you know I
am not clever, and poor Ned&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stamped her foot on the floor. "Let me have
none of your commiserations," she cried. "There is
nothing poor about it at least."</p>

<p>She put Hester down at the table with pen and
ink to write for her. She had not said a word of
compassion to her; this had been the way she had
chosen to express her feeling, whatever it was.
When Harry had interposed, begging to be allowed
to do it, she had stopped him summarily; and had
gone on thus, collecting information, dictating to
Hester, examining papers with Harry, asking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
hundred questions, till morning was blue in the skies.
When she saw by that strange light stealing in, how
wan and wretched her two companions looked,
Catherine rose from her chair. She was not tired&mdash;her
colour was as fresh and her eyes as bright as ever,
her mind full of impatient energy; but the powers of
the others had flagged.</p>

<p>"Go home and rest," she said to Harry. "Have
old Rule there to-morrow morning to meet me. I
will come to the bank to-morrow&mdash;I mean to-day&mdash;at
eight, before you open. Go home and go to bed."</p>

<p>"Not if I can be of any use to you, Aunt Catherine&mdash;or
to poor Ned."</p>

<p>Her foot made the same impatient movement upon
the carpet. "You can be of no use," she said, "dropping
asleep as you are: go and rest; at your age few
can do without sleep. And Hester, go too, you can do
no more." It was not without a half contempt that she
saw the overpowering of their young faculties by that
which to her was nothing. There are so many things
in which youth has the best of it, that age has a right
to its dolorous triumph when that comes. She went
down with Harry to the door to let him out, glad of
the movement, and stood in the early light for a
moment breathing in the fresh air. The birds were
all twittering, making their morning thanksgiving,
expressing their joy in the new day. Catherine
looked out sternly upon the light and gladness in
which she had no share. She thought again&mdash;should
she ever think of anything else?&mdash;of the last words
she had heard, and of his figure hurrying away in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
darkness, deaf to her cry. It was a relief to go in
again, even to see the poor little lamp flickering, and
the light bursting in at every crevice of the ineffectual
shutters. When she reached the room in
which they had been at work, Hester, who had
answered as far as her faculties could to every call
upon her, had dropped back into the great chair in
which she had been sitting, and had fallen asleep in
utter exhaustion. It was a curious scene. The
windows were all closed, and candles upon the table
still burning: but the light swept in from above, over
the top of the shutters, which were not so high as the
glass, and lighted up the room in a strange abstract
way like a studio or a prison. In the midst of this
pale and colourless illumination Hester's white face,
with the blue veins showing in it, in an attitude of
utter abandonment and exhaustion, pillowed upon
the dark cushions of the chair, was the central point;
her hand with the pen in it was still on the table, the
candles flickering with a yellow uncertain blaze.
Catherine went and stood by her for a moment and
looked at her. Tears were upon the girl's long eyelashes,
her mouth seemed still quivering, the faint
sound of a sob came out of her sleep. She looked
younger even than she was, like a child that had
cried itself asleep. Catherine looked at her with
many a thought. John Vernon's daughter, who had
all but ruined her father's house, and had wounded
her own pride, if not her heart, in the way women
feel most&mdash;and bitterer still, Edward's love, she, for
whom he had planned to betray her own better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
claims, for whom he would have deserted her, for
whom he had ruined her, this time perhaps without
remedy. With a strange bitterness she looked at the
young creature thus fatally connected with all the
miseries of her life. It was not Hester's fault. The
table was covered with proofs of her submission and
obedience. If it was true that but for her perhaps
Catherine's power would never have been disturbed,
it was also true that but for her Catherine might
have been ruined irretrievably, she and all she prized
most. But this argument did not tell in the mind of
the woman who stood gazing at her, so much as the
look of utter infantile weariness, the broken sound of
the sleeping sob, the glitter upon her eyelashes. She
stood for a long time, and Hester never moved.
Then she took a shawl and covered the sleeper as
tenderly as her mother could have done it, and
began to pace softly up and down in that weird
clearness. She did not even extinguish the candles,
but left them there amid all the disarray of the table,
the scattered papers, covered with notes and figures.
The young can sleep, but not the old. The romantic
interest would be with Hester worn out with
wretchedness and weariness; but the heavier burden
was her own.</p>

<p>Perhaps had the truth been pursued to its depths
it gave a certain satisfaction to Catherine to find
herself at last left to contemplate alone that uttermost
and profoundest loss which was hers. The girl
slept though her heart might be broken; the woman
whose last hope he was, whose faith in human nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
was wound up in him, who believed in Edward, but
on earth in no one else, slept not, rested not, could
not forget. She walked from end to end of the room,
her hands clasped, her face in all its comely age
paled in a moment to the pallor of an old woman.
People had said that her colour was like a girl's still:
her eye was not dim nor her natural force abated.
But over her there had come this chill in a moment.
And where was he, the cause of it all? Flying fast
across the country somewhere, directing his way, no
doubt, to some port where he could get out of England.
For what, oh Heaven, for what? Was there
any sacrifice she would not have made for him? He
might have had his Hester, his own house like the
others, if that was what he wanted. There was
nothing, nothing she would have grudged him! She
would have asked no gratitude, made no conditions.
He should have had his freedom, and his love&mdash;whatever
he wanted. All this swept through her
mind as she went to and fro in that blue clearness of
the morning which swept down upon her from the
skies over all the weariness and disarray of the night.
Catherine did not ask herself what she would have
said, all things being well, if she had been asked to
consent to the effacing of herself, which now it seemed
would have been so easy a solution of the problem.
It seemed to her now that in love she would have
granted all he could ask for, and in pride she certainly
would have done it, scorning to ask how he
could resign her so easily. Love and pride combined
wrung her heart between them now. Up and down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
up and down with a soft monotonous motion she
walked unsubdued while the others sank. Her old
frame felt no weariness, her old heart was yet high.
She could no more sink down and acknowledge
herself beaten, than she could drop her head and
sleep like Hester. With impatience and an energy
unbroken she waited for the day.</p>

<p>Catherine's carriage stood outside the bank at
eight o'clock in the morning, to the wonder yet
admiration of the town. "Old as she is, she's an
example to the young ones," the people said: though
there were darker rumours, too, that one of the
young men had gone wrong, and that it was a sharp
and speedy inquiry into this that had brought
Catherine into the town without delay. The still
closed door was opened to her by Harry, who was
pale with his sleepless night and with the anxiety
from which he could now find no escape. Behind
Harry was old Rule, who came forward with a face
like a mute at a funeral, his hands held up, his
countenance distorted with grief and sympathy. "Oh,
my dear lady!" he cried; "oh, Miss Catherine, has
it come to this? Who could suppose that you and I
should meet together a second time in this way?"</p>

<p>Catherine made a sudden gesture of impatience.
"How do you know what the way is until you
hear?" she said. She sat down at the table where
she had sat so often. Her old look of command, the
energy and life of old, seemed in her face; if it was
paled and jaded, the others, who were more shaken
still than she, had no eyes to see it. The three were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
deep in their work before the clerks appeared, one
by one, all those who were of any weight in the
place, or cared for Vernon's, asking anxiously if
anything was known of Mr. Edward. When they
were met by the astonishing statement "Miss Vernon
is here," the announcement was received in different
ways, but with great excitement. "Then all is right,"
said one; but another shook his head. "All must
be very wrong," he said, "or Catherine Vernon would
not be here." It was the cashier who uttered these
words. He was an old servant of the bank, and had
been a junior at the time when old Rule was head
clerk and Catherine the soul of everything. After a
while he was sent for into the mysterious room
towards which the attention of every one was now
directed. There old Mr. Merridew was shown in
with solemnity on his brows, and various others of
the fathers of the town. Even outside there seemed
a little excitement about to the anxious spectators
within. If it had been market-day there might
have been a run on the bank. As it was, there
were one or two little groups about, anxiously
noting the grave faces of the visitors. All day long
they came and went; the great books were all
spread about upon the table within, and when the
door opened sometimes one anxious face would be
seen, sometimes another. One of the younger men
passing the door saw Catherine herself explaining
and urging something upon the chief of the Bank
of England in Redborough, who had joined the
conclave. It was clearly then, they all felt, a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of life and death. Some wine and biscuits were
taken in in the middle of the day, but no one went
away for luncheon, no one had time or leisure for
any such thought. Mr. Pounceby, who was Catherine's
solicitor, stayed by her all day long, while
the others went and came. The clerks, when their
day's work was done, left this secret conclave still
sitting. The cashier and the head clerk were
detained after the others. The younger men went
away with an alarmed sense that Vernon's might
never open again.</p>

<p>And this impression was so far justified that the
councillors, almost without exception, thought so too.
There had been found in Edward's room at the
Grange a bundle of papers, securities taken by him
from the safe at the bank. The greater part had
been abstracted, but the few that were left showed
too clearly what methods he had adopted. The
bank itself was worth aiding. Its prestige as yet
was scarcely touched; but how were these deficiencies
to be made up, how was it to be worked
without money, and how was its credit to be restored?
Catherine had not now the independent
fortune which on the former occasion she had thrown
into the common stock with proud confidence in
Vernon's. It had all been repaid her, but it had
remained in the business, and if Vernon's now were
to be made an end of, was gone. That did not
affect the mind of the proud old woman. She
thought nothing of herself or her fortune. She sat
unwearied, meeting one man after another, who a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
week or two ago had been obsequious to her, without
wincing, ready to hear all their doubts, to bear the
shakings of their heads, their blame of the culpable
negligence that had left everything in one man's
hand&mdash;their denunciations of Edward, the eager
advantage they took of that right to find fault and
reproach which is put into the hands of every man
who is asked to help. Catherine faltered at first,
when she found that to save Edward's character,
to smooth away his guilt, and make excuses for him
was impossible. These angry men would not hear a
word of apology. He was a swindler to them and
nothing more. "Pardon me, my dear Miss Vernon,
but I always thought the confidence you showed in
that young fellow excessive." "He should not have
been permitted a tithe of the power he had. It
was not just to others who were far more deserving."
"If you mean me, I was no more to be matched with
Edward than a tortoise is with a hare," said Harry.
Catherine put out her hand to him under the table
and gave his hand such a pressure, delicate as hers
was, as almost made the strong young fellow cry out;
but at the same time she silenced him with a look,
and bore it all. She bore everything&mdash;the long
hours of contention, of explanation, of censure, of
excuse, of anxious pointing out again and again of
the strong points in her case. She argued it all out
with every individual, and again with every combination
of them, when two or three together would
return to the old objections, the difficulties they had
originally started, and which again and again had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
been argued away, with no doubt the natural special
pleading of all who speak in their own defence.
During this continually repeated process Harry would
stand behind her with his face of trouble, watching
the countenances of the speakers, now and then
blurting out something (the reverse of judicious in
most cases), shuffling with uneasy feet upon the
floor; sometimes, poor fellow, there being nothing
else in his power, holding her elbow with the idea
of supporting her, kneeling down to put her footstool
straight; while old Mr. Rule, sitting at a little
distance, equally anxious, equally eager, not of
importance enough to speak, would come in with
a quavering "Miss Vernon explained all that, sir&mdash;"
"As Miss Vernon has already said, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She alone showed little anxiety and no distress.
She was as dignified as if she had been entertaining
them at her table, as she had done so often. She
bore those repetitions of the old objections with
composure. She did not get impatient, twisting and
turning in her chair like Mr. Rule, or crushing her
impatience under foot like Harry. She was like an
Indian at the stake: or rather like a prime minister
in his place in Parliament. The hundred times
repeated argument, the old doubt brought up again,
all afresh with shakings of the head, the stolid little
compliments to her as a woman so much superior to
her sex, her masculine understanding (good lack!
wonderful, though not equal to those whom she had
convinced over and over again, yet who began again
next moment where they had left off), all this she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
put up with without shrinking. Oh, the dulness of
them, the unconvinceableness, the opaque vision, the
impotent hearts! But she made no sign that she
perceived. She sat still and held her own. She had
the best of the argument in logic, but not, alas, in
power. Ten mortal hours had struck by the time
the last of her visitors hastened away to his dinner,
promising to think of it, yet shaking his head.
Catherine leant her head upon the back of her high
chair and closed her eyes; the tears came to them in
the relief of having no more to say. She was so
pallid and so worn now that they both rushed to
her in silent terror. She opened her eyes with an
astonished look. "I hope you do not think I am
going to faint; I never faint," she said.</p>

<p>Ten hours! She walked to her carriage with a
foot lighter and firmer than that of Harry, upon
whose fine physique and troubled soul this day had
wrought more havoc than the severest football. She
would not allow her old friend and servant to come
to the door with her.</p>

<p>"Don't tire yourself," she said. "You have so
much to do for us yet. I think we shall pull
through."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Miss Catherine," said the old
man; "if we pull through it will be your doing."</p>

<p>"What merit is that?" she said quickly. "Why
should God bless me for that? It is for myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear lady," cried the old clerk. "I know
you better than you do yourself. It is for Vernon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and not for you. And Vernon's means the honest
living of many a family. It means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me what it means," she cried, putting
up her hands. "It means downfall and shame now.
It means a broken heart, Mr. Rule."</p>

<p>"No, no," he cried. "No, no, we'll get through.
I'll come back if you'll let me, and Mr. Harry will
work like a hero."</p>

<p>She gave Harry a strange glance. There was in
it a gleam of repugnance, an air of asking pardon.
She could not endure the contrast which it was not
possible to refrain from making. He, standing by
her, so dutiful, so kind, while the other who had
ruined her, fled away. She could have struck him
with her nervous hand, which now was trembling;
she could have made a humble confession to him of
the injuries she had done him in her heart. She
could bear the old town dignitaries, the men of
money, better than this.</p>

<p>"May I go with you?" he said, supporting her
with his arm, bending over her with his fair countenance
full of trouble and sympathy.</p>

<p>She could have struck him for being so good and
true. Why was he true, and the other&mdash; Better,
better if they had both been alike, both traitors, and
left her to bear it by herself.</p>

<p>"No, Harry," she said; "no, Harry, let me be
alone."</p>

<p>He kissed her hand, poor boy, with a piteous look,
and she felt it wet with a tear. Nor did she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
misunderstand him. She knew it was for her he was
sorry. She knew even that he was the one alone
who would stand up for the absent, and excuse him
and pity him. All this she knew, and it was intolerable
to her, and yet the best and sweetest thing
that was in her lot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>AFTERWARDS.</h3>


<p>Hester woke next morning in an unfamiliar room
with a consciousness of something strange and terrible
that had happened, she could not tell what, that
first sensation before memory awakens which is one
of the most bitter indications of having entered upon
the world of evil. So the guilty pair in Paradise, in
the morning of the world, must have woke out of
their sleep, and felt, before remembrance came, the
sense of ill. She scarcely remembered how she had
been transported to that bed. She had slept for
sorrow, calamity crushing all her unused faculties,
and her first waking sensation was one of trouble
and wonder what it was. She had not long to wait
before the whole came rushing back upon her mind.
She gave a low cry, and all her wounds began to
bleed anew&mdash;nay, she felt them as for the first time,
for last night's terror and commotion and misery
were like a dream to her. When she uttered that
cry, there was a soft stir in the room, and a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
noiseless figure, and anxious face appeared at her
bedside.</p>

<p>"Mother!" Hester cried, with a voice of dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, my darling, I am here. Catherine was so
good as to send for me. She said you had received
a great shock. She went out herself very early, so
that you need not be afraid of being disturbed,
Hester. And what is it, my dear? She would not
give me any satisfaction. She said you had behaved
very well, and had been the means of giving her
valuable information. I am very glad of that anyhow,
Hester. I always told you she was kind in the
main. If you and she should be better friends after
this it would be a great pleasure to me."</p>

<p>There was anxiety in Mrs. John's plaintive face,
but it was confined to the fear lest her daughter's
health should be affected, and to a little uncertainty
whether the relations with Catherine might be
improved or injured by this mysterious event,
whatever it was.</p>

<p>"She has been very kind, mamma."</p>

<p>"I was sure of it, my dear. Catherine has a way
with her that is not very&mdash;<i>nice</i>&mdash;sometimes. But
then we all have some fault. I was to ring for tea
as soon as you were awake. That maid, after all,
though I have always had a prejudice against her, is
kind too, in her way. She has made me most comfortable.
I have always observed in my life, Hester,
that when you get to know people you so often think
better of them than when&mdash; That has been my
experience. Do you feel able to take some breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
dear? or will you get up first? You are to do
exactly as you please."</p>

<p>Hester lay still with a little moan, and made no
reply. She would have liked to turn her face to the
wall, to beg that the light of day might be shut
out, that she might be left to make acquaintance
with her trouble. But none of these things were
possible. Her mother's gentle face shining upon her
with so much easy anxiety, and so little conception
of anything under the surface, brought her to herself
as nothing else could have done. Why should she
be troubled with these anguishes that were beyond
her? The girl raised herself with that heroism of
necessity which is more effectual than mere will.
Mrs. John would weep with her, and make up to her
with a thousand caresses for the loss of her lover,
when she came to understand it; but she would
never understand the burden that was on Hester's
soul. The girl said to herself that it must be borne
silently, that there must be no further betrayal.
She begged her mother to leave her a little, while
she got up.</p>

<p>"I have had a long sleep. I am quite myself
again," she said.</p>

<p>"You look pale," said Mrs. John, kissing her. "You
have had a shock, and you have never told me yet
what it was. But perhaps, on the whole, the best
thing you can do is to get up; breakfast in bed is not
very comfortable. I will go and have a good look at
Catherine's pretty things in the drawing-room&mdash;she
has some nice china&mdash;and come back in half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
or so. Don't hurry, my darling, but it is such a
lovely morning; it will do you good to have some
fresh air."</p>

<p>When Hester was left alone she tried to think,
but could not. Scenes came back to her as in a
theatre&mdash;the meeting at the gate, and all that passed
there; Catherine's appearance, and the force with
which Edward flung her away from him, and set out
into the dark, into the unknown. Why&mdash;why had
he done it? Was it in a sudden fit of passion, which
he had repented of? Was it in the terror of being
discovered&mdash;and out of that suspicion and opposition,
and gloomy distrust which had always been in his
mind towards Catherine? And then the railway
would rise before her mind&mdash;the crowd and noise,
and wild unnaturalness of everything, the disappointment
which to her at heart was a relief. Had he
not gone after all? What if a better thought had
struck him? What if, when they all went to the
bank, thinking him a traitor, they should find him
there, throwing light on everything, putting the
wrong right? Hester raised her head again when
this thought came into her mind. Was it not after
all the most likely, the most natural thought? A
man does wrong by temptation, by evil companions,
by the leading on of one wrong thing after another;
but when he is brought to a pause, when there is a
distinct call upon him, when he is made to see
beyond dispute what his duty is, is it not natural,
certain, that he must do it? So she said to herself.
For a moment all the clouds flew away, a warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
exhilaration took possession of her. Then there
floated up before her eyes another scene&mdash;the table
round which they had sat in the dead of night;
Harry with his troubled face opposite to her; Catherine
paramount in her energy and rapidity; she
herself putting down upon paper, so quickly that her
fingers alone moved and her mind had no share but
the most broken and imperfect one, what she was
told to write. If he had come back, if he was
working now at the re-establishment of everything,
could Edward ever forgive them? What matter,
what matter, she cried, so long as he set himself
right, so long as Vernon's stood by his help and did
not fall? From all this it will be seen that nothing
of the despair which in reality and in reflection had
overwhelmed all the other chief actors in the drama,
had touched Hester. To her everything was still
possible, and Edward's vindication, Edward's repentance,
the chief, the most natural event of all.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, are you ready?" said Mrs. John.
"There is quite a nice breakfast waiting for you down
stairs. Catherine's maid (whom I really was unjust
to, Hester, for she is a very nice woman when you
come to know her) insisted upon making you some
chocolate instead of tea: for it would be more
sustaining, she said, in case you should not be disposed
to eat. I don't know why she should think
you would not be disposed to eat. I told her you
always liked your breakfast. But come, my dear,
come, I am sure you must want something. Did
you find the clean things I brought you? Oh I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
thought you would be better in a nice clean print,
instead of that dark thing; but you have put on the
old one all the same."</p>

<p>"It is best for me to-day," Hester said.</p>

<p>She thought to herself if it all turned out as she
hoped, with what joy she would return to her summer
garments in the evening, even if it might be that
Edward had broken with her for ever. She thought
this almost certain, for had she not turned against
him? but this was not the question paramount in her
mind. There was but one thing all important, that
he should have returned to his post. Mrs. John was
greatly surprised at the wisdom of that prevision
on the part of Catherine's maid. How could she
have foreseen that Hester, a healthy girl, with generally
a healthy appetite, would turn away almost
with loathing from the dainty food, the pretty tray,
the careful provision made for her? She swallowed
the chocolate hastily at her mother's entreaty: the
very air of the house, those stairs and passages, all
flooded with light, which had painted themselves on
her recollection in the darkness, filled Hester with a
sense of the intolerable. She made haste to get out,
to get away, to take her mother home.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it will only be polite to wait till
Catherine comes back?" Mrs. John said. "You must
remember, dear, that she has been very kind to you;
and nothing could be kinder than her note, and
sending the carriage for me this morning, and all. I
think we ought to wait and thank her for her kindness.
She will think it strange that we should go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
away without a word. Well, if you think it really will
be better to come back in the afternoon, Hester&mdash;Has
Catherine gone out to spend the day? That is quite
unusual, surely for her&mdash;but however, of course it is
not our business. Lean on my arm, my dear. I am
sure, as you say, the air will do you good."</p>

<p>The air did not do Hester good: the shade of the
holly-tree lying motionless upon the road, the half
open gate at which Catherine had appeared in the darkness,
the strange intelligence that seemed to be in
every bush, as if these inanimate things knew and
remembered what had been done and said in secret,
seemed to bring conviction, and force back upon her
all the scenes she had gone through of which her
innocent mother knew nothing. And every inch of
the way recalled her own proud, eager thoughts of
the night before, the desperation with which she had
gone to that meeting, determined upon her protest
and refusal, yet never sure that she would ever retrace
these steps again. To retrace them now as she was
doing, with her mother's gentle talk in her ears, the
occasional mild question which it was so easy to
elude, the praises of Catherine which her supposed
kindness called forth so easily, seemed an incredible
thing. Mrs. John enjoyed the walk. It was seldom
she went out in the morning, and the excitement of
her daughter's absence all night, of Catherine's
explanations, of the drawing together of some new
and closer bond between Hester and the head of the
Vernon society&mdash;the most important person of all
the kindred&mdash;gave her a secret exhilaration. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
had not been such a sensation in the Vernonry for
months as that which had been caused that morning
by the sight of Catherine's well-known brougham,
sent for Mrs. John! It might be that in future this
would be no rare sight: it might be&mdash;but the poor
lady scarcely knew how to contain the satisfaction
with which she saw the vista opening up before her
of Hester's promotion and favour with Catherine.
Valuable information! She was proud of what
seemed to her like the highest praise. She always
knew that her Hester, so much superior as she was to
other girls&mdash;&mdash;if Catherine but knew her as she
deserved to be known. And then she asked with
pleasant expectation&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was the information, Hester, that you gave
Catherine? I am so glad that you were able to tell
her something she didn't know. I was quite in a
flutter when I got her note last night; but of course
it was perfectly right for you to stay when she wished
it. I shall tell her I am so much obliged to her for
having taken such good care of you. It gave me
quite a fright for the moment, but I soon got over
it. And Emma, you know, went away at last by the
night train."</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. John diverted her own attention and
never pressed a question. But it is impossible to
tell how deserted, how silent, how far out of the
world and life the little rooms at the Vernonry looked
after the agitation of the night. Hester could not
rest in them: the summer forenoon seemed a twelve-month
long. She could not take up any of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
usual occupations. She was afraid to meet any one,
to be questioned perhaps more closely than her
mother had questioned her. Her heart was away, it
was not in this place. In the pauses of Mrs. John's
gentle talk she felt her own thoughts thronging upon
her almost audibly. It seemed impossible that other
people, that even her mother, unsuspicious as she
was, should not find her out. And how slow, how
slow were those sunshiny minutes, sixty of them in
an hour! The time of the early dinner came, and
again Hester turned from the food. Mrs. John began
to be alarmed. "If it goes on like this I shall have
to send for the doctor," she said.</p>

<p>Hester hastened out as soon as the meal was over
to escape from her mother's comments. It seemed
to her that she recognised some new knowledge in
the keen glances of the sisters, and in Mr. Mildmay
Vernon's grin as he sat over his newspaper in the
summer-house. And she was afraid of the old Morgans,
who had more insight. The surroundings of the
house altogether were odious to her&mdash;unnecessary
things that had nothing to do with those real affairs
and mysteries of living which were being solved
elsewhere. She asked herself wistfully, whether it
was not time for her to go back: though if Catherine
had not returned, what could she do but cause
suspicion if she went to the empty house? To be
even in the empty house would be something&mdash;it
would be so much nearer the scene in which everything
was going on. While she stood with her hand
curved over her forehead looking out upon the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
with her eyes "busy in the distance shaping things
that made her heart beat quick," the old captain came
up to her. She thought he was paler than usual, and
his eyes were troubled. He had laid his hand on
her shoulder before she heard his approach, so
absorbed was she in her own thoughts. He took her
by the arm in his fatherly way&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come with me, Hester, and talk to my old
woman," he said.</p>

<p>It was with a great start that she turned to him,
trembling with nervousness all unknown to the
Hester of yesterday.</p>

<p>"Is she ill?" she cried, scarcely knowing what she
said; and then with a vague smile, "I forgot. Emma
is gone, and she is missing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not Emma we are thinking of. Hester, tell
me," said the old man, leading her away with her arm
in his, "what is this about Catherine? What has
happened? Your mother told us you were there all
night, and now to-day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do they say has happened?" cried Hester
with a gasp of suspense.</p>

<p>"I cannot make head nor tail of it. I hear that
one of the young men has gone wrong; that Catherine
is at the bank; that there are great defalcations;
that he went off last night&mdash;&mdash;I can testify," cried
Captain Morgan, querulously, "that he did not go
away last night, for I was there."</p>

<p>Hester looked up at him with a face from which
all colour had fled.</p>

<p>"Is it known who it is? are you sure he has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
come back? Oh, I have a feeling," she cried, "a
feeling in my heart that he has come back!"</p>

<p>"My child," said the old captain, "you may trust
her and me. Whatever it is, it is safe with her and
me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan was sitting at the window in her
summer place; her placid brow had a cloud upon
it, but was not agitated like her husband's.</p>

<p>"Have you come back to us, Hester?" she said.
"We thought we had lost you. If you can satisfy
his mind with anything you can say, do it, my
dear."</p>

<p>"What can I say?" Hester cried. "We are all in
great trouble. I don't know which is the greatest,
but I cannot tell you secrets that are not mine. Dear
Mrs. Morgan, tell the captain so. Whatever I know
it is by accident. I think I shall die with anxiety
and suspense, but there is nothing I can say."</p>

<p>"My dear, you will not die, you will live to be
anxious many another day. Rowley, my old man,
you hear the child. We must not ask her another
question. Wait, as you have waited many a time
before. It is all in the Lord's hands."</p>

<p>The old man was wiping the moisture from his
forehead: he had seated himself as soon as he came
in, his old limbs were shaking under him. His large,
colourless hands shook, holding his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said, "if it is my flesh and blood that
has brought this disturbance into the place, that has
seduced her boy, and brought down ruin on her
house, how am I ever to lift my head again?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>The old lady looked at him with pathetic eyes, in
which there was a suffering as acute as his own,
softened and made almost bright by the patience and
calm that were habitual to her.</p>

<p>"Rowley, we are not thinking of Catherine, we are
thinking of ourselves," she said.</p>

<p>And then there was a pause. It seemed to Hester
that her own brokenheartedness was a sort of child's
passion in comparison. She said humbly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what you are afraid of? There
is nobody blamed but one. There is not a name
spoken of but one. I don't know if that is any comfort
to you, Captain Morgan."</p>

<p>"And the one is her boy, the apple of her eye, the
only one that she has trusted, her choice out of all
the world," the old lady said. "Oh be silent, be
silent, my old man! What is your pride to that? I
would rather I had a share of the burden&mdash;I would
like to be suffering with her." The tears stood in
the deep wells of those old eyes, which had wept so
much. She was past weeping now. "The Lord
forgive him and bring him back," she said.</p>

<p>"You mean punish him, you mean give him over
to the powers of darkness that he belongs to! What
does he deserve, a man that has used a woman like
that?"</p>

<p>"I am not asking what he deserves. I will tell
you what he would get if he would come back.
Pardon!" said the old woman with a sob, instinctively
putting out her old soft hands.</p>

<p>"I am not for pardon," said the captain vehemently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
his head moving in his agitation, his hands
shaking. "I am for every soul bearing its own
burden. Here is a woman that has spread prosperity
around her. She has been kind, even when she has
not been merciful. The grateful and the ungrateful,
she has been good to them all. She has been like
the sun shining and the rain raining upon both just
and unjust. And here is the end of her, stung to
her heart by the child of her bosom. For it will be
the end of her. She is a grand woman. She won't
bear being deceived."</p>

<p>"Do not say that," said Hester; "she is so strong,
stronger than any of us&mdash;if you had seen her last
night!"</p>

<p>"Where could I have seen her last night?" he
said quickly; then, with a smile, "that is all you
know, you children. Yes, stronger than any one of
you, able to do everything. Do you remember the
French boy in Browning's ballad, Hester, that could
not bear it when his Emperor asked if he were
wounded? 'I'm killed, sire!' That is like Catherine.
She stands like a tower. I can see her in my
mind's eye. She needs no sleep, no rest: but she is
killed for all that."</p>

<p>Hester rose to her feet as he spoke in an excitement
she could not control.</p>

<p>"I must go," she said. "I must go&mdash;I might be
wanted."</p>

<p>The old man rose and hobbled out after her. He
followed her to the gate.</p>

<p>"I will wait while you get your hat. I am coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
with you," he said. "We cannot rest, Hester,
neither you nor I."</p>

<p>Mrs. John was dozing in her chair as she generally
did in the afternoon. She opened her eyes and said,
"Are you going for a walk, dear?" then closed them
tranquilly again. The very atmosphere in the brown
wainscotted parlour breathed of peace and quiet
uncongenial with any such throbbings as those in
Hester's heart. She joined the old man, who was
waiting for her at the door, and they went on together,
saying little. The great window in the
Grange where Catherine usually sat commanding
the road was vacant. There was a certain deserted
air about the place. They knew without a word
that Catherine was still out of it.</p>

<p>"It is too far for you to go," Hester said.</p>

<p>Though they had not spoken for a long time they
understood each other <i>&agrave; demi-mot</i>.</p>

<p>"It is too far for me," said he, "but what does
that matter? everything will soon be too far for me.
Let me go on while I can."</p>

<p>They walked as far as the bank, where their
anxious eyes made out the people lingering about,
the air of curiosity and excitement. Old Captain
Morgan hobbled up to Mr. Merridew, who was making
his way out with a serious face. "You will excuse me
for my anxiety, sir," he said, "but will you tell me if
Miss Vernon is there, and what is going on?"</p>

<p>"That is an easy question you are asking me,"
said Mr. Merridew, eying him closely; "certainly
Miss Vernon is there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am her near relation," said the old man, "and
you are connected with her by marriage."</p>

<p>"I know very well who you are, Captain Morgan:
a distinguished officer, though people have not found
it out here. If you can lend Miss Vernon substantial
help I advise you to do it at once."</p>

<p>Captain Morgan drew back a little: he gave
Hester a pathetic glance. They retired slowly with
lingering steps from the vicinity of Vernon's. They
understood all without knowing anything.</p>

<p>"There is the bitterness of having nothing," said
the old captain, "and that man knew it, Hester. I
would coin myself if I could, for her, and yet I
cannot help her." Neither of them knew about
business, nor how men like Mr. Merridew, who had
been listening all day long to Catherine's explanations
and arguments without being moved, could save
the bank still if they would. But they felt in their
hearts the dull opposition of his face, the shake of his
head, the nature of his advice to one whom he knew
to be a poor man, to help her now. "Money is a
wonderful thing," said Captain Morgan; "it can do
so much and yet so little. If you or I were rich as
we are poor, we could make Catherine think for half
an hour that she had surmounted everything."</p>

<p>"Why for half an hour, Captain Morgan?" said
Hester.</p>

<p>"Because, my dear, at the end of that time
Vernon's being safe, there would come back upon
her that from which neither heaven nor earth can
deliver her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Morgan, do not say so. Cannot
Heaven, cannot God, deliver from everything?"
cried Hester, with a sense of horror.</p>

<p>"Ay, in a way that He uses always at the end&mdash;by
death. At least we think death will do that for
us; but it is only a guess even then. How otherwise?"
said the old man, raising his dim old eyes
beneath their heavy lids. "What is done cannot
be undone. If the boy were to be touched with
compunction too late and come back, even that
would not restore the past."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said, "why not? We could
forgive him." It was the first acknowledgment she
had made of any share in the catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Forgive him! You speak as if that could change
anything! What is your forgiveness? You seem to
think it is a thing, not so many words." Then after
they had gone a little while in silence the old man
burst forth again. "You could forgive him! A man
wants not forgiveness, but to make up for his sins.
You think it is like giving him a fortune to give him
your pardon, as if he could set up again, and make a
new beginning upon that. Forgiveness may save a
man's soul, but it does not save his honour or his
life. You could have him back and let him live
upon you, and eat out your hearts with his baseness
trying to make it show like virtue. But Catherine
is too noble a creature for that," cried the old captain.
"Thank God she has never been broken down
to that."</p>

<p>This torrent of words overwhelmed Hester; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
had turned into the quiet road again, and the girl
fell into a low sobbing and weeping as she went.
She was too much overstrained to be able to
control herself. Yet her heart struggled against this
sentence.</p>

<p>"If you love any one is it only while he is good?"
she said. "Is it noble to cast him from you because
he has gone wrong? Then what is love or faithfulness?
Are they nothing&mdash;nothing?"</p>

<p>She knew now that he had not come back. Honour
had not moved him, nor love, nor any nobler impulse.
She could have flung herself upon the earth in her
misery. She felt that a touch now would be too
much&mdash;that she could bear nothing further. And
her companion saw that she was beyond the reach of
any argument. He was silent, and they moved
slowly along together, he tottering on his aged
limbs, scarcely able to get along.</p>

<p>"Soon everything will be too far for me," he said
with a half-pleased, almost satisfied nodding of his
head. It took them a long time to get home, and
the old captain was so worn out that he could not
rise from his chair again that evening. He and his
old wife sat sadly, saying something to each other
once in half an hour. They could think of nothing
but Catherine. They kept up their broken musing
discussion upon her and her fate as the slow summer
evening again crept silently by.</p>

<p>But Hester could not rest. She satisfied her
mother easily that it was right she should go back
to the Grange and find out if she could be of use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is what I was going to suggest, my dear," said
Mrs. John. "If Edward Vernon is away, as you say,
and nobody with her, she must be lonely. And if
there is any trouble besides&mdash;though you have never
rightly explained to me what it was. No no, dear, I
don't mean to say it is your fault. No doubt you
have told me, and I have not taken it up. To be
sure, Hester, you must go; and though I cannot bear
to be without you, yet if Catherine wants you, and
she is in trouble, stay. I am sure she would do as
much for me," said the simple soul, without any cold
breathings of doubt. She went to the gate with
Hester, and when she came back could not help
giving her neighbours a little sketch of the state of
affairs. "My Hester has gone back to the Grange,"
she said, "she will probably stay there all night.
Catherine Vernon wrote me the nicest note to tell
me my child had been of so much use to her; that
is always gratifying to a mother."</p>

<p>"Of use!" cried the ladies both together.
"Gracious goodness, what can be going to happen?
Hester of use!" cried one sister. "And to
Catherine!" said the other. "Dear Catherine,
she tells you so to please you&mdash;when probably she
is thinking you the greatest bore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She likes something new to experiment upon,"
said Mr. Mildmay Vernon with a snarl. Mrs. John
was much discouraged by this reception of her news.
She said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You little know my child if you think she will
be experimented upon," holding her head high; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
when she got indoors she cried a little over their
ill-nature. If it had been one of them who had
been chosen how different would have been their
tone. Had the brougham been sent express for Miss
Matilda or Miss Martha, what airs they would have
given themselves! and Mrs. John knew that she
had given herself no airs: she had not said a word.
But she could not be silent about the promotion of
her child.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>AN INTERRUPTION.</h3>


<p>Catherine was in her usual chair in the familiar
room where she had lived for so many years. These
walls had witnessed most of the pleasantnesses and
disappointments of her life; within them she had
grown into that amused spectatorship of all the
pranks of human creatures which it had pleased her
to think was her characteristic attitude, indulgent to
everybody, seeing through everybody. They had
never seen her in the aspect which she bore now,
beaten down under the stroke of fate. She was too
far gone even to be conscious of the extraordinary
irony of life which had made of the one only creature
to whom she had been consciously unjust, whom she
had considered from her childhood as an enemy, her
sole ministrant and sympathiser now. But she was not
conscious even of Hester's presence, who, overpowered
by a great awe of the suffering which she shared, kept
herself in the background, recognising, as so few
watchers do, that she was there for the sake of the
sorrowful woman whom she watched, and not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
for her own. Catherine lay back in her chair, her
head thrown back, her eyelids half closed. She did
not move, except now and then to put up her hand
and dry the moisture which collected slowly under her
eyelids. It could not be called tears. It was that
extorted dew of pain which comes when the heart
seems pressed and crushed in some giant grasp. She
was not thinking, any more than it is inevitable to
think as long as life remains. She was only suffering,
nothing more. She could not make any head
against it. Her last stronghold had fallen. This it
is which makes calamity so terrible to the old. She
could not get beyond it. There was nothing, nothing
in her path but this, blocking it across with a darkness
that would never be dispersed. If he had died
she would have known she could not remain long
behind him, and the gloom would have been but a
mist between; but he had not died. The thought of
searching for him through the world, of holding out
succour to him when he came to need, of forgiving,
that last prerogative of love, was scarcely in her
nature. It was hers rather to feel that deep impossibility
of re-beginning, the misery and pain of any
struggle to make the base seem noble, which is as
true a sentiment as the other. She could not have
done it. To many women it is the highest form of
self-abnegation as it is the bitterest lot that can be
borne on earth; but to Catherine it would not have
been possible. The blow to her was final. There
was but one thing&mdash;to fight for Vernon's to the last
gasp, to ward off disgrace and failure from the name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to keep the ground it had occupied so long, against
possibility, against hope; but after that no more&mdash;no
more. She had borne herself bravely as long as any
eye was upon her, betraying nothing; and had sat
down to table and tried to eat, with that utter self-mastery
which will sustain the life it loathes with
sedulous care so long as it is necessary&mdash;talking to
Hester at intervals, giving Marshall directions as if
nothing had happened. She had been first impatient,
then satisfied to find the girl there. Her presence
was a help in that needful struggle.</p>

<p>Catherine went up stairs after dinner as usual.
Nothing was changed; but when she had attained to
that shelter, she could do no more. She put back
her head and closed her eyes, and gave herself up to
the endurance of her death-blow. At the other end
of the room Hester sat motionless. A keen-sighted
spectator would have seen the outline of her figure
in her dark dress, but nothing more. She was
watching, forgetting her own share, intent upon the
other. Her mind was full of what the old captain
had said, "I'm killed, sire." Hester watched with a
great awe, wondering if even thus, in the silence,
without any more demonstration, a woman might die.
She thought in her heart it would be well; but being
so young she was afraid. And the silence was so
deep, more deep than life could tolerate. She
watched eagerly for that sole movement, the lifting
of Catherine's hand to dry away the moisture from
her eyes.</p>

<p>This stillness was broken suddenly by a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
knocking at the door&mdash;a continued volley of knocks,
accompanied by the sound of voices outside. Then
this sound surged inwards, and hasty steps were
heard rushing up stairs. Hester's heart leaped to
her mouth. It could not be that <i>he</i> would come
back with such a noise and outcry; but yet a sort of
frantic hope took possession of her as she rose to her
feet. Catherine had raised herself too, and sat with
her eyes widely open fixed upon the door. They
had not long to wait. The door was flung open,
dashing against a cabinet which stood near, with a
superfluity of noise and emphasis; and, sweeping
away the silence before her, and every possibility of
calm, Ellen Merridew burst into the room, her eyes
inflamed with crying, her fair countenance streaked
with red, her light locks standing up round her face.
She was followed by her husband, trying to hold her
back, and by Marshall in the rear, eager&mdash;under a
respectable semblance of attending the hasty visitors&mdash;to
give accuracy to the floating suspicions of the
servants' hall, and find out what it was all about.
Ellen rushed in, and gazed about her wildly.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she cried. "Oh, Aunt Catherine,
where is he? You are hiding him, I said you
would hide him, whatever he did. Oh, is it nothing
to you if he goes and ruins people that never did him
any harm?&mdash;young people like us that have all our
life before us, and a dear baby to be turned out upon
the world. Oh, Aunt Catherine, if you have any
heart at all, where is he, where is he? I'll have him
to justice!" cried Ellen. "I'll not sit under it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
won't&mdash;not if he should kill me! I want Edward.
Where is Edward? I sha'n't go out of this till you
give him up to me. He has ruined us, he has ruined
us!" cried the excited creature, bursting into a
transport of passionate tears.</p>

<p>There had been a moment of bewildered struggle
in Catherine's face; then she rose up with what
seemed to the excited new comers her usual composure.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" she said, in her quiet
voice.</p>

<p>Hester had shut the door upon the servant's
curiosity; Ellen crying violently, and poor Algernon,
endeavouring vainly to console her, stood between
the two, in the centre of the room. It was all that
poor young Merridew could do not to weep too.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will forgive her, Miss Vernon," he
said, in faltering tones. "We are nearly out of our
senses. Oh, don't cry, my dearest; whatever they
do they can't part us, and I'll work for you and baby.
I'll work till I drop. Miss Vernon, if Edward's here&mdash;she
doesn't mean any harm. She is just off her
head, poor girl! and baby not a month old yet.
If you will only let us see him, I'll pledge my
word&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Algy, hold your tongue!" cried Ellen amidst
her sobs, stamping her foot. "Hold your tongue,
I tell you. She'll never, never give him up&mdash;never
till she's forced, I know that. She has always liked
that fellow better than the whole of us put together.
And we've every one kotoued to him for her sake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
He's been the head of everything, though he was
nothing but a poor&mdash;&mdash; And as frightened of her
as a dog, and hated her all the time. Oh yes, Aunt
Catherine, you may believe me or not, but whenever
there was a word about you, Edward was always
the worst. Of course we all had our remarks to
make, I don't say anything different; but he was
always the worst. And now he's gone, and led
Algy to his ruin," she cried, with another wild outburst.
"We have lost every penny. Do you hear
me, Aunt Catherine, do you hear me? We're
ruined, with a dear baby not a month old, and I
that have never got up my strength. Oh yes, Algy,
yes, dear. I know you'll work till you drop. But
what good will that do to me, to have you work
yourself to death, and to be left a widow at my age,
with a baby to support? And, Aunt Catherine, it
will all be your fault," cried Ellen. "Yes, it will be
your fault. If you hadn't made such a fuss about
him, who would have ever trusted him? It was
because of you I gave my consent. I said Aunt
Catherine will never let him come to harm. And
now here it has all come to smash, and me and Algy
are ruined. Oh, how can you have the heart? and
a dear innocent baby without a word to say for
himself! And me at my age&mdash;and poor Algy that
thought he was making so good a marriage when he
got one of the Vernons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nelly, Nelly, darling!" cried the poor young
fellow, "I married you because I loved you, not
because you were one of the Vernons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he had a good right to think so," said Ellen
pushing away his caressing arm. "And they all
thought so&mdash;every one; and now they've turned
against me, and say I'm extravagant, and that I've
ruined him. Oh! me to have ruined him that
thought I was making a man of him! Aunt
Catherine! Will you let us all be sacrificed, every
one, only to keep Edward from harm?"</p>

<p>Catherine Vernon had sunk into her chair, but
there was something of the old look of the spectator
at a comedy again upon her face. The evening was
beginning to fall, and they did not see the almost
ghastly colour which had replaced the wonderful
complexion of which everybody once spoke.</p>

<p>"Make her sit down, Algernon, and stop this
raving," she said. "What has happened? I know
nothing of it. If you have any claims upon Vernon's
you will be paid with the rest&mdash;if we stand, till the
last penny, if we fall, to the utmost that can be paid.
I cannot say any more."</p>

<p>They both sat down and gazed at her with consternation
on their faces; even Ellen's tears dried
up as by magic. After she had stopped, they sat
staring as if stupefied. Then Ellen got up, and threw
herself at Catherine's feet with a cry of wild dismay.</p>

<p>"Aunt Catherine! you don't mean to say that you
cannot help us, that you cannot save us? Oh, Aunt
Catherine! don't be angry with me. I did not mean
to make you angry. I was always silly, you know.
You will help us, you will save Algy, you will pay
the money, won't you?" She crept close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Catherine, and took her hand and kissed it, looking
up piteously, with tears streaming down her face.
"You'll do it for me, Aunt Catherine? Oh, though
I am silly I am fond of my husband. And he's so
good; he's never said it was my fault. And I always
knew you would put it right. Aunt Catherine! you
will put it right?"</p>

<p>Her voice rose into a shrill, despairing cry; then
she dropped down helpless, sobbing and moaning,
but still holding by Catherine's hand and her
dress, whatever she could grasp at, in a passion of
incredulity and despair.</p>

<p>Then Catherine, who had been so stately, sank
back into her chair.</p>

<p>"I can't bear any more," she said, "I can't bear
any more. For the love of God take her away!"</p>

<p>But it was only the sudden appearance of Harry
which put an end to this painful scene. He gathered
his sister up in his arms, while her husband was
ineffectually intreating and reasoning with her, and
carried her out of the room, with a severity and
sternness which silenced the young pair.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, taking them into the
deserted library which had been Edward's room,
"we are all in the same box. He has ruined her
and us all. You, out of your own confounded folly,
the rest of us&mdash;I can't tell you how. He has ruined
<i>her</i>. God&mdash;forgive him!" cried Harry, with a long
pause, bringing out the last words with a violent
effort. "But, look here! The only hope we have
of pulling through is in her. They can't let Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Vernon be ruined in Redborough. I don't think it's
in the heart of man to do it; but if we drive her
into her grave, as you've been trying to do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, how dare you say so! I only went
to her&mdash;where should I go?&mdash;and I thought it
would be all right. I thought it was dreadful, but
I never believed it, for I know Aunt Catherine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ellen, hold your tongue, for God's sake! If we
kill her, it's all up with us. Hasn't she got enough
to bear? I brought a cab when I knew you were
here. Take her home, Algy, and keep her quiet,
and let's meet and talk over it like men," Harry
said, severely.</p>

<p>He had never so asserted himself in all his life
before. They hurried her out between them to the
cab, much against Ellen's will, who wanted explanations,
and to know if it was true that Aunt Catherine
couldn't, couldn't if she would; and then told them,
sobbing, that if it was so, none of them could afford
to pay for a cab, and why, why should ruined people
spend a shilling when they had not got it? The
cabman heard part of these protestations, and
Marshall another part. But on the whole both
Algernon and Harry were more occupied with her
in her transport, more anxious for its consequences,
more tender of her, than if she had been the most
self-commanded and heroic woman in the world.</p>

<p>When this tempest of interruption swept away,
Catherine was still for a few minutes more. Then
she called Hester to her in a voice of exhaustion.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "it has done me no harm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Anything is better than that which&mdash;is always
behind. And I must do nothing to hurt myself
before to-morrow. Was not Harry there? He may
have something to tell me. Let him come and say
it to you. You are quick witted, and you will
understand; and if it is worth writing, write it
down. I will not take any part. I will keep still
here. If it rouses me, so much the better. If not,
you will listen for me with your young ears, and
forget nothing. I must save myself, you see, for
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I will forget nothing," Hester said.</p>

<p>Catherine smiled faintly, with her eyes closed.</p>

<p>"I had thought of making you bring me some
wine. There is some Tokay in the cellar; but one
always pays for a strong stimulant, and this is the
better way. You are young, and you are a Vernon
too. Bend your mind to it. Think of nothing but
the business in hand."</p>

<p>"I will," said Hester, with solemnity, as if she
were pronouncing the words before a judge.</p>

<p>Catherine took hold of her dress when she was
going away.</p>

<p>"One thing," she said. "I think you and I have
hated each other because we were meant to love
each other, child."</p>

<p>"I think I have always done both," said Hester.</p>

<p>The faint sound that broke through the stillness
was not like Catherine's laugh. She patted the
girl's arm softly with her hand. Their amity was
too new to bear caresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now go and do your work, for your honour and
mine," she said.</p>

<p>It appeared that Harry had much to say. It was
strange to have to say it all to the young and eager
listener, her eyes glowing with interest and anxiety,
who was not content with any one statement, but
questioned and investigated till she had brought out
every point of meaning, while the real authority sat
by silent, her eyes closed, her hands clasped, like an
image of repose. Both the young people kept their
eyes upon her. There was not a movement which
Hester did not watch, while she exerted her faculties
to comprehend everything that Harry told her, and
put down everything that seemed at all important.
The impulse carried her over her own share of the
individual misery. Everything else disappeared
before the paramount importance of this. When
all that Harry had to say was said, there arose a
silence between them which had the effect which
nothing before had of rousing Catherine. She
opened her eyes and looked at them kindly.</p>

<p>"Everything has been done as I wished," she
said. "I have gleaned something, and the rest you
will tell me, Hester, to-morrow. It has been a rest
to me to hear your voices. You can expect me,
Harry, at the same hour."</p>

<p>"Is it not too much for you, Aunt Catherine? It
is everything for us that you should come."</p>

<p>"I will come," she said. "It is easier than staying
at home. Fatigue is salvation. Now I am going to
bed, to sleep. Oh, I mean it. I cannot do my work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
without it. You will come too in the morning,
Hester, when I send for you? Then, good-night."</p>

<p>They watched her go away with her step still
stately. Her faithful maid, whom Mrs. John had
found so kind, but who had not always been kind, was
waiting for her. The two young people stood and
looked after her with eyes of tender respect and awe.</p>

<p>"I thought once," said Hester, in a hush of subdued
feeling, "that she might have died sitting in her
chair."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Harry, who had a little more experience,
"it is seldom that people get out of it so easily
as that. I want to tell you something more if it will
not&mdash;upset you more."</p>

<p>Hester smiled.</p>

<p>"Is there anything that can upset me more?" she
said.</p>

<p>He looked at her wistfully. He did not know
what her individual part in this trouble had been;
whether Edward was more to her than another, or
what the position was in which they stood to each
other.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to take it," he said, "or how
to understand it. There are news of&mdash;Edward."</p>

<p>The last gleam of hope shot across Hester's
mind.</p>

<p>"He is coming back?" she said, clasping her
hands.</p>

<p>Harry shook his head.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me to the door? It is such
a lovely night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>She had not the courage or the presence of mind
to say no. She went down stairs with him, where the
lamps were lighted again, and out to the gate&mdash;the
same hour, the same atmosphere as last night. Was
it only last night that all had happened? She could
have turned and fled in the tremor, the horror of the
recollection. Just there she lay at Catherine's feet.
Just there Catherine had stood and listened.</p>

<p>Hester stood her ground like a martyr. She knew
she must learn to do so, and that it would not be
possible to avoid the place made so bitter by recollection.
Harry did not know how to speak. He
shifted uneasily from one foot to another. "He has
been traced to town; he got in at the junction, not
here. He reached London this morning, very early&mdash;with
a lady."</p>

<p>"With a lady!"</p>

<p>Hester had expected a great shock, but the
astonishment of this took its sting away.</p>

<p>"They left this afternoon, it is supposed to go
abroad," Harry said.</p>

<p>"Still with the lady? That is very strange," said
Hester, with a little quiver in her lips.</p>

<p>"There is reason now to suppose that he&mdash;married
her in the meantime."</p>

<p>Hester had grasped by accident the post of the
gate. She was glad she had done so. It was a
support to her, at least. Married her! It gave her
no immediate pain in her astonishment, which was
unspeakable. In the dusk Harry did not see her
face. He had no conception of the real state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
case. The fact that Edward had been discovered
with another woman had confused Harry and diverted
the natural suspicions which had risen in his mind
when he had found Hester so linked with Catherine
after the discovery of Edward's flight. He watched
her with a little alarm, wondering and anxious. But
the only sign of any emotion was the tightening of
her hand upon the iron gate.</p>

<p>"You will know," he said, "whether it will be
best to say anything of this. If it will hurt her more,
let it alone till the crisis is past."</p>

<p>"If it will hurt her&mdash;more? I do not think
anything&mdash;can hurt her more."</p>

<p>"And you are nearly over-worn," he said, with a
tender and pitying cadence in his voice. "I can't
say spare yourself, Hester. You are the only one she
deserves nothing from. She ought to feel that: if
he is gone who owes her everything, yet you are
standing by her, who never owed her anything."</p>

<p>Hester could not bear it any longer. She waved
her hand to him and went in&mdash;into the house that
was not hers, where there was no one who had a
thought to bestow upon her. Where was there any
one? Her mother loved her with all her heart, but
had nothing to say to her in this rending asunder of
her being. She thought she was glad that it was all
happening in a house which was not her home, which
after, as Harry said, the crisis was past, she might
never need to enter again. She went up stairs, to
the unfamiliar room in which she had spent the
previous night. There she sat down in the dark on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the bed, and looked at it all, passing before her eyes,
like a panorama. For this was the only description
that could be given. The conversation just recorded
occurred over again, as if it had been in a book.
"With a lady!" "They left this afternoon."
"Reason to suppose that in the meantime&mdash;" And
then this talk, suspended in the air as it seemed,
came to a pause. And Hester, through the interval,
saw all her own long stormy wooing, its sudden
climax with so much that was taken for granted&mdash;"My
only love!&mdash;and I am your only love." That
was all true. Those agitated scenes, the dances that
were nothing but a love duel from beginning to end, the
snatches of talk in the midst of the music and tumult,
the one strange blessed moment in the verandah at
home, the meeting so tragical and terrible of last
night. That was a sort of interlude that faded again,
giving place to Harry's steady subdued voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Married her in the meantime! Married her!"</p>

<p>Hester said these words aloud, with a laugh of
incredulous dismay and mockery. The sound terrified
herself when she heard it. It was Catherine's laugh
made terrible with a sort of tragic wonder. Married
her! Had there been no place for Hester at all,
nothing but delusion from beginning to end?</p>

<h3>THE SETTLEMENT.</h3>


<p>The records of the next few days were agitated
and full of excitement. Day after day Catherine
spent at the bank, immersed in calculations and consultations
with every one who could throw the
slightest light upon the matter. Everything oozed
out by degrees, and it was said now that Edward was
being hunted down by detectives, now that he had
escaped altogether, now that his defalcations were
so tremendous that nothing but absolute ruin was
possible for Vernon's, now that there was enough left
to make a fight upon if only the creditors would be
merciful, and give time, and have patience. The usual
panic with which such news is received was somehow
tempered in this case. It was thought in the
district that Catherine Vernon was enormously rich,
and independent of the bank, and when it was known
that she had not abandoned it, but in her old age
had come back, and was in the office every day,
struggling to retrieve affairs, there was nobody short
of the financial authorities of the place who did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
believe that all was safe. Catherine Vernon would
not see any harm come to the bank; Catherine
Vernon would see everybody paid. This popular faith
held up with a certainty of obstinate prepossession
which was worth so much solid capital to the tottering
house. Catherine herself placed everything she
had in the world in the common stock. She it was
who took the lead in all the discussions. She
rejected the provisions for her own comfort which
everybody concerned was anxious to make. The
prevailing feeling among all who had any power was
at first that the re-establishment of the whole concern
was hopeless, but that enough might be saved out of
the wreck to enable Catherine to end her days in
peace. To this she opposed a determined negative.
She would have no arrangement made on her behalf.
"Do you think I want," she cried, "to end my
days in peace? I am ready to die fighting, on
the contrary, rather than sacrifice the place my
father lived and died in and his father before him.
Don't speak of peace to me." It was when they
perceived that she was immovable in this point and
was determined to denude herself of everything, that
the old contemporaries who had stood by her before
in her gallant struggle, and had been her competitors,
and had lived to see themselves distanced by Catherine,
had felt it impossible to persevere in their
refusal to help. She would have no charity, she
declared with a flushed cheek. Help for Vernon's,
yes, to set them on their feet again, with a certainty
that nobody should lose a penny in the long run&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
that she would thank them with a full heart;
but help for herself, to keep her in a show of comfort
when the reality was gone, no! "not a farthing,"
she said. "I am not afraid of the workhouse," said
Catherine, with proud calm, "and I have a right to
a Vernon almshouse, the first that is vacant. Nobody
will deny that I am Redborough born, and of good
reputation. I will not take a penny. Do you think
I could not live in a single room and eat my rations
like another? It is because you don't know Catherine
Vernon yet."</p>

<p>The old men who had known Catherine Vernon
all her life could not withstand this. "We must
manage it for her, we must do it somehow," they
said. "Vernon's is an old name among us. There
is no name in all the district that the people have
such confidence in. We must try, sir, we must try,"
they began to say to each other, "to help her
through." The young men, many of them, were
impatient, and would have refused to consider the
question at all. What had an old woman to do
with business? She ought to be thankful if she
was allowed a maintenance, and to terminate her
days in comfort. But on this point there was not
another word to be said. The Grange and everything
in it was to be sold, the White House and the
old furniture, part of which Mrs. John still remembered
so fondly. There was no question as to that.
"We are prepared to sacrifice everything," Catherine
said. "What we desire is not to keep up any false
pretence, but to carry on our business and recover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
ourselves by your help. Dismiss me from your mind.
I will take my chance; but think of Vernon's, which
is not hopeless, which has life in it yet." Old Mr.
Rule on his side had pages upon pages of statements
to put before the gentlemen. The week was one of
terrible suspense and misery, but at the end, though
with conditions that were very hard upon the pride
of the family, it was decided at last in favour of the
bank. Certain great capitalists came forward to
prop it up, "new blood" was put into it in the shape
of an enterprising manager, who was to guide Harry's
steps. There were bitternesses, as there is in every
cup that is administered by strangers. But Catherine
had gained her object, and she made no complaint.
Vernon's would continue, and Harry might
have it in his power still to retrieve the family
fortunes. As for all the rest, what did it matter?
She was a woman who was, or thought herself, very
independent of material conditions. Whether she
lived in the Grange or one of the Vernon almshouses,
what did it matter to her? She did not care for
fine eating or fine clothing. "Besides, my clothes
will last out my time," she said with a smile. The
week's struggle had been good for her. She had not
forgotten the great and enduring grief which lay
behind all this. But she had not had time to think
of it. She had put it away out of her mind as a
strong nature can, till her work was done. It was
waiting for her to overwhelm her: but in the
meantime she was strong.</p>

<p>Roland Ashton hurried down as soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
terrible news reached him. He was eager to tell
her his own connection with it, to prove to her that
it was not he who had led Edward into speculation,
that he had done his utmost to restrain him, and
had even in his anxiety been willing to embark in
what he felt to be a hazardous course in order to
save Edward from the rashness he feared. He came
down with all his details ready and a burning anxiety
to set himself right. But when he reached the scene
of all their troubles, Roland never said a word to
Catherine on the subject. Such details were beyond
the case. She had never willingly spoken of Edward;
when it was possible she ignored him altogether; the
investigations which had been set on foot, and which
had revealed the greater part of his secrets, she had
been compelled to know of, but had spoken to no
one about them. Since the first day his name had
scarcely passed her lips. Harry only had been
allowed to tell her that he had baffled all the
attempts made to find him, and had escaped. The
search after him had been indeed made rather to
satisfy anxiety than with any design of punishment,
for the other partners in the bank were responsible
for everything, and it was on their shoulders that the
burden had to fall. He disappeared as if he had
fallen into the sea or been lost in a railway accident.
The most wonderful complication of all, the companionship
in which he had left England, was not
told to her then. It threw to all the others a
horrible mockery upon the whole story. There was
a bitter sort of smile upon Roland's face when he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
with the old people, and told them all the investigations
he had made, the incredulous indignation with
which he had received the first idea that Emma's
disappearance could be connected with that of
Edward, the growing certainty that it was so, and
finally the receipt of her letter which he brought
them to read. The old people were very sad for
their beloved Catherine and little inclined to laugh,
but the old captain indulged in a tremulous roar
which was half a groan, and the old lady, who
allowed that her sense of humour was small, gave a
grieved smile when it was read to her. This is
what Emma said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Roland</span>,&mdash;I think it my duty to let you
know, as it was, so to speak, in your house I was
living at the time, how it is that I had to make up
my mind at a very short notice, and couldn't even
go through the form of referring Edward to you. I
met him in the train, as you will probably have
heard. I was rather sorry about leaving Redborough,
and so was he too till he saw me beside him. And
then it turned out that he had been very much
struck with me at Ellen Merridew's parties, and
would have spoken then but for some entanglements
that were of old standing, and that he could not
shake off. I need not mention any names, but if I
say it was some one that was quite out of the question,
some one that was detested at the Grange, you
will know. He told me he was leaving England for
ever, and would I come with him? You know I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
have always thought it my first duty to get settled,
being the youngest and without any fixed home.
So after thinking it over for an hour or two, and him
being so anxious to come to the point, which is
generally just where gentlemen are so slow, I thought
it best to consent. We were married before a registrar,
but he says that is just as legal as in church.
It was at the registrar's in Holywood Street, Trentham
Square. We are going to travel, and may be
moving about for a good while; but when we settle
I shall let you know. I am glad to tell you that we
shall be quite well off, and have everything very
handsome; and Edward never grudges me anything
I fancy. Give my love to them all, and let them
know I am as happy as possible, and that I am Mrs.
Edward Vernon now, which is one of the prettiest
names I know.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Your affectionate sister,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Emma.</span>"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was the last that was heard of this strange
pair for a number of years. They discovered that
Edward, after many losses, had made a sudden successful
venture which had brought him a sum so
large as to turn his head. He had been utterly
demoralised by all the excitements he had passed
through, and the sense of a reckoning which he could
never meet, and he had not given himself time to
think. He disappeared into the unknown with his
ill-gotten gains and the wife he had picked up in the
midnight train, and was seen no more. As for poor
Algernon Merridew, who was his victim, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
only as his own eagerness and that of his wife to get
money anyhow, made him so, he had to descend, like
all the rest, from his temporary grandeur and gaiety.
Old Merridew was as stern now as he had been indulgent
before, and Ellen, who had been almost
worshipped as one of the Vernons when she glorified
the family by entering it, was now the object of
everybody's scoffs and accusations. But Ellen was
a girl of spirit, and equal to the circumstances.
Algernon got a humble place in the bank, and the
little family lived with Harry, putting their small
means together until better days came; but adversity
and a determination at least not to let herself be
insignificant had so inspiring an effect upon Ellen,
that she kept the impoverished household as gay as
the extravagant one had been, by cheaper and better
means. The Merridew girls, once so subservient,
learned what she called "their place" when she was
poor more effectually than they had done when she
was rich. And her brother, always by her, who,
though he had losses, was still the chief partner in
the bank, Catherine Vernon's nephew, and the bearer
of a name which commanded respect in all the
district, kept the balance even. When Vernon's
flourished again Algernon became a partner, and
all the past grandeurs of the beginning were more
than realised.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, when it had just been
decided that Vernon's, bolstered up by a great deal
of supplementary aid, was to go on again, there was
much commotion among all the dependents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
house. For one thing it was decided that as the
Grange was to be sold, the most natural refuge for
Catherine was at the Vernonry, her own house, from
which some of her dependents must go to make room
for her. This was the one point upon which she had
made no personal decision, for it hurt her pride to be
obliged to dismiss one of those for whom she had
provided shelter so long. There had been a great
effort made to make her retain the Grange, and continue
her life in its usual course, a little retrenched
and pared away, yet without any great disturbance
of the habitual use and wont. This she would not
consent to, making the protest we have seen, that
external circumstances were nothing to her, that one
of the Vernon almshouses would be as good a shelter
as any other for an old woman. But she shrank
from bidding any one of her pensioners to make
room for her in the Vernonry. It raised a wonderful
commotion, as may be supposed, in the house itself.
All the dwellers on the garden side were disposed to
think that Mrs. Reginald, whose boys were now
growing up, and two of them in what their mother
called "positions," was the right person to go. But
Mrs. Reginald herself was of opinion that her house,
a good deal battered and knocked about by the boys
in the course of their bringing up, was not in a fit
state to receive Catherine Vernon, and that the
other side, which was the best, was the natural
place for her. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways could
think or speak of nothing else.</p>

<p>"Our little place," they said, "is far too small for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Catherine. She could not turn round in it. Of
course we would turn out in a moment; it would be
our duty. But dear Catherine, used to such large
rooms, what could she do in ours, which is the size
of a pocket-handkerchief? And if Mrs. Reginald
will not budge, why there is Mrs. John. She is so
intimate with Catherine nowadays. Hester, that
used to be such a rebel, and whom Catherine, we
all know, could not endure, is always there. Dear
me, of course there cannot be a doubt about it.
Mrs. John's house is the right thing; she must have
that," which was a great relief to their minds.</p>

<p>Mr. Mildmay Vernon made a great many faces
over his newspaper as he sat in the summer-house.
He reflected that the hot water-pipes would be sure
to get out of order in winter, and who would now
repair them? He did not commit himself by any
remark, but he thought the more. When Mrs. John
told him of the opinion of the sisters, and consulted
him with a troubled countenance, he only shook
his head.</p>

<p>"I am sure I would do anything for Catherine,"
Mrs. John said, "especially now when she is in
trouble; but we cannot go far from here, for Hester
is so much with her; and where are we to get a
house? There is nothing within reach but that
little cottage on the road. I am sure, if I were Mrs.
Reginald, with no particular tie, and her boys in
town, such a long way to come, I don't think I
should have any doubt as to what my duty was."</p>

<p>It was a question which Hester at last solved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
her hasty way, declaring that wherever they lived
Catherine must have the best place in her own
house&mdash;a principle to which her mother was obliged
to make a faltering adhesion. But while every one
was thus resisting, Mr. Mildmay Vernon was carrying
on his reflections about the hot water-pipes.</p>

<p>"She put me next the trees on account of my
rheumatism," he said to himself. "I know she did,
and I shall never live through a winter if the apparatus
gets out of gear. And I can't afford to pay
for the fire, that's clear." The result of which reflection
was that Mr. Mildmay Vernon made it
known that he had received a legacy which would
make a little addition to his income, and he could
not think any longer of taking up room which he
believed was wanted. "Besides, one may accept a
favour from one's cousin," he said, "especially when
it is not much of a favour, being the damp part of
the house which few people would have taken had
they been paid for doing so&mdash;but to be indebted to
a firm of bankrupts is impossible," Mr. Mildmay
Vernon said.</p>

<p>He took his departure in the beginning of the
winter, just when the want of the hot water-pipes
would be beginning to make itself felt. And it was
almost without consulting her mother that Hester
made arrangements for removing their few household
goods into his house, to leave their own free
for the mistress of all. Mrs. John consented to the
arrangement, but not without a few tears.</p>

<p>"It is not that I mind the difference," she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
"in the size of the rooms, or anything of that sort.
But it feels like coming down in the world."</p>

<p>"We have all come down in the world," said
Hester; "and Catherine most of all."</p>

<p>And then Mrs. John cried for Catherine, as she
had first done for herself, and resisted no more.</p>

<h3>THE END.</h3>


<p>It was early in November when the time came for
Catherine to leave the Grange. She had made a
selection of a very few things to go with her, and all
the others had been valued for the sale. She spoke
quite cheerfully about the sale. She had gathered a
great many valuable things about her, and it was
thought they would sell very well. She had some
pictures which had been in the house for generations,
and some things which her great-uncle had picked
up when he made the <i>grand tour</i>. And there was a
great deal of valuable china and quantities of old
silver, the accumulations of a family that had not
been disturbed for generations. She showed no feeling
about it, people said; and indeed Catherine felt
that neither about this nor any other external thing
was she capable of showing much feeling. She cared
nothing about leaving the Grange. Had she been
actually brought down as far as the almshouse, in all
likelihood she would have taken it with the proudest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
placidity. What was there in that to move a soul?
One room was very much like another if you went
to general principles, though it might be larger or
smaller. Were these matters to make one's self
unhappy about? So she said, fully meaning it, and
with a smile. She was at the office every day. It
seemed a matter almost of economy to keep for the
present the brougham with its one horse which took
her there; but of everything else she divested herself
with the frankest good will. To the outer world
she kept her good looks, though she was thinner,
and her complexion paled; but those who watched
her more closely found that there were many changes
in Catherine. "I'm killed, sire," old Captain Morgan
still said. He himself had given them a great
alarm; he had had "a stroke" in the beginning of the
winter, but it had passed away, though he still said
everything was too far for him, and found his evening
hobble to the Grange too much. He went as
often as he could, sometimes to bring Hester home,
who was always there to receive Catherine at her
return, sometimes only to sit and talk for an hour
in the evening. With other people when they
came, Catherine employed the same plan which she
had first set on foot with Harry. She made Hester
her representative in the conversation. She said it
did her good, while she rested, to hear the voices
and to take into her mind now and then a scrap
of the conversation. But it seemed to Hester that
she paid less and less attention to what people said.
She was very cheerful in her time of business, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
when she lay back in her chair in the evenings, she
was so still sometimes that but for her hand now
and then stealing to her eyes, her anxious companion
would scarcely have known that she lived. She
thought nothing of her health for her own part, and
constantly said that she was quite well and that her
work agreed with her. There had been a little excitement
in her appearance when she came home in
the evening of the last day she was to spend at the
Grange. Hester thought it was the coming change
that occasioned this, though Catherine declared her
indifference to it. She talked with a little haste
and excitement during dinner, and when they were
alone afterwards did not flag as was her wont, but
continued the talk. "It is a great pity," she said,
"a girl like you, that instead of teaching or doing
needlework, you should not go to Vernon's, as you
have a right to do, and work there."</p>

<p>"I wish I could," Hester said, with eager eyes.</p>

<p>"They tell me you wanted to do something like
what I had done. Ah! you did not know it was
all to be done over again. This life is full of repetitions.
People think the same thing does not
happen to you twice over, but it does in my experience.
You would soon learn. A few years'
work, and you would be an excellent man of business;
but it can't be."</p>

<p>"Why cannot it be? You did it. I should not
be afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was old. I was past my youth. All that sort
of thing was over for me. It could be in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
way&mdash;if you could make up your mind to marry
Harry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I could not&mdash;I could not! I will never marry."</p>

<p>"It is a great pity you cannot&mdash;I think it is
a mistake. I have done him a great deal of
injustice in my time; but one finds out sooner or
later that brains are not everything. There is
another man, and he has brains, who would marry
you if you would have him, Hester&mdash;Roland Ashton.
Take him&mdash;it is better in the end."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not ask me! I will never marry," Hester
cried.</p>

<p>Then Catherine suddenly sat upright in her chair,
and clasped her hands together with almost wild
emphasis. "I would marry," she cried, "if I were
you! I would wipe out every recollection. Did they
tell you the pitiful story of a meeting in the train, a
marriage suddenly made up&mdash;and who it was that
went away into the darkness in what was to have
been your place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they have told me," said Hester, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Lord in Heaven!" cried Catherine, "what a
world, what a world this is!&mdash;all mockery and delusion,
all farce except when it is tragic. And after
that you will not marry&mdash;for the sake of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can I help it?" cried the girl, with wistful
eyes. "You do the same yourself."</p>

<p>"Myself? that is different. Your heart will not
be empty for ever, Hester. It cannot close itself up
for ever. With me that was the last;&mdash;this is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
thing that makes a mother like no one else. Hold
the last fast, they say. It was everything one had to
look to. I am very cheerful, and I shall live for
years&mdash;many people do. But I have got my death
blow," Catherine said. Then the silence dropped
again between them. It was before a cheerful fire,
with a lamp burning&mdash;altogether a more cheerful
scene than in those sad summer days.</p>

<p>"There are some people who would not take much
interest in it," Catherine continued, "but you do. I
think you are like me, Hester. We were kept apart
by circumstances; perhaps it is possible we might
have been kept apart on purpose. "He"&mdash;Catherine
made a pause before and after, and said the word
with a sob&mdash;"never understood me. They say he
was&mdash;afraid of me, never could trust me with what
he really wished. Alas, alas! It must have been
my fault&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no!"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, yes. I had rather think that; and there
is a great deal that is base in me. I could not but
laugh even at that story of Emma&mdash;even now.
Human nature is so strange&mdash;it is a farce. I am not
angry though, not at all: all things seem floating off
from me. I could think we were floating away
altogether, you and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are not well. You are doing too much. I
should like to send for the doctor."</p>

<p>"I believe in no doctors. No, no; I am quite
well, only tired with the day's work and ready for
rest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>And the silence resumed its sway. She laid
herself back as before&mdash;her pale head against the
dark curtains stood out like ivory. Some time
afterwards she sighed two or three times heavily,
then there was no sound at all. The fire burned
cheerfully, the lamp shed its steady glow upon
Hester's book, to which after this talk she did not,
as may be supposed, pay very much attention. But
Catherine did not like a vacant watcher, and the
book was a kind of safeguard, protecting her from
the sense of an eye upon her. Perhaps an hour
passed so. A chill crept into the room like nothing
Hester had ever felt before, though all was still,
serenely warm and bright to outward appearance.
She rose softly at last and touched Catherine's
hands, that were folded in her lap, to wake her. It
was from them the cold had come that had crept
to her heart.</p>

<p>There was, then, no need that Catherine Vernon
should ever live in cramped rooms, in another house
from that in which she had been born. When they
carried her out from it a week after, the whole population
came out to meet the procession, and followed
her weeping, lining the path, filling the streets.
Her misfortunes, and the noble courage with which
she had stood up against them at the end, brought
back all the fulness of the love and honour with
which she had been regarded when she first became
supreme in the place, and all bounty flowed from her.
There was not any one connected with her, high or
low, not only the poor Vernons who had snarled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
scoffed while they accepted her favours, but the
very men of money who had of late taken upon
themselves the air of patronising Catherine, but was
proud to be able to repeat now, on the day of her
burying, what she had said to them, and how they
had come in contact with her. The doctors were not
clear as to how she died. She had never been suspected
of heart disease, or any other disease. But it
was her heart somehow, with or without a medical
reason for it, that had failed her. The last touch,
those who loved her thought, had been too much.
Derision such as she had delighted in in other
circumstances, had overtaken the last tragic occurrence
of her life. Catherine had not been able to
bear the grim mockery, the light of a farce upon
that tragedy of her own.</p>

<p>And as for Hester, all that can be said for her is
that there are two men whom she may choose
between, and marry either if she pleases&mdash;good men
both, who will never wring her heart. Old Mrs.
Morgan desires one match, Mrs. John another.
What can a young woman desire more than to have
such a possibility of choice?</p>
